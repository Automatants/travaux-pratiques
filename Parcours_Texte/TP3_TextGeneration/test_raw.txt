MORTY: Summer, next time we're hiding in a Colorkian echo nest, can you do me a favor and turn your ringer off?
SUMMER: It's called "carpe diem", Morty. Look it up.
MORTY: You look it up! Y-Y-You don't even-You don't even know what it means!
SUMMER: That's because losers look stuff up while the rest of us are carpin' all them diems.
[SUMMER HI-FIVES RICK]
RICK: Listen to your sister, Morty. To live is to risk it all. Otherwise, you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you. Oh, I'm sorry, Jerry, I didn't see you there. H-How much of that did you hear?
JERRY: All of it. You were looking right at me. I just wanted to say goodbye to the kids.
RICK: Cool. Just stay in the driveway. The killbots are live, and I took you off the whitelist.
[RICK BEGINS USING A SCREWDRIVER ON A GUN]
MORTY: W-We'll see you every other weekend, though, right?
RICK: Absolutely, Morty. A-And your mom's lawyer says if I can get enough in the settlement, he can help me sue for full custody.
MORTY: Th-That'll be nice. Uh, Summer, Dad's leaving!
SUMMER: Bye, Dad. Rick, didn't you say you needed my help on an adventure immediately somewhere else I don't care even if it might kill us?
RICK: I did not, but if you're really that alienated, I'm as willing to exploit it as the next guy, church, army, or Olympic gymnastics trainer.
[RICK SHOOTS OPEN A PORTAL IN THE GROUND]
SUMMER: I'm ready when you a--
[SUMMER JUMPS INTO THE PORTAL AND EXITS]
RICK: Bitch, I was ready yest--
[RICK JUMPS INTO THE PORTAL AND EXITS]
JERRY: Bye, sweetie.
MORTY: Well, I-I better--
JERRY: Sure. Sounds important.
[MORTY JUMPS INTO THE PORTAL AND EXITS] [BETH ENTERS THE GARAGE]
JERRY If you're looking for our kids, your father did a-a portal, uh--
BETH: Okay.
[BETH EXITS. JERRY BEGINS TO WALK OUT OF THE GARAGE BUT STOPS. SOME LEAVES BLOW IN THE WIND]
WIND: (faint) Loser...
JERRY: What? Hello?
[TRANSITION TO RICK DRIVING SUMMER AND MORTY IN A TURQUOISE CAR THROUGH THE DESERT, BEING CHASED BY OTHER CARS]
RICK: Morty, shoot the mohawk guy!
MORTY: They all have mohawks!
RICK: High fade, chartreuse with cyan highlights, layered on top. Shoot him!
[MORTY LOADS A SHOTGUN AND SHOOTS AT THE VEHICLE BEHIND THEM, BUT MISSES, WHILE MOHAWK GUY JUMPS ONTO THE BACK OF THEIR CAR]
MOHAWK GUY: Ah!
DEATH STALKER #1: Light them up.
MOHAWK GUY: Ahh!
[MOHAWK GUY PRESSES A BUTTON AND SELF-DESTRUCTS]
RICK: Fuck! Get in the game, Morty!
SUMMER: Give me your flask!
[RICK HANDS SUMMER HIS FLASK. SUMMER CHUGS SOME ALCOHOL FROM IT, THEN SPITS IT INTO THE ENGINE, PROPELLING THE CAR FORWARD]
RICK: Holy shit, Summer for the win!
SUMMER: I fucking love post-apocalyptic versions of Earth!
[A MACHINE BEGINS TO BEEP RAPIDLY.]
RICK: Here we go.
[RICK PULLS THE CAR OVER, AS HIM, SUMMER, AND MORTY ALL EXIT.]
RICK: Isotope 322. [RICK PICKS UP A GLOWING GREEN SHARD WITH A PAIR OF TWEEZERS AND PUTS IT INTO A CONTAINER. IT FLOATS IN THE CONTAINER.] This stuff's so powerful, Morty, it makes Isotope 465 look like Isotope 317.
MORTY: Uh-huh, yeah, is it powerful enough to keep those guys from murdering us?!
[MORTY POINTS TOWARDS THE CAR THAT WAS COMING TOWARDS THEM WHICH IS QUICKLY APPROACHING THEM. SUMMER GRABS A SHOTGUN FROM THE FRONT SEAT OF THE CAR]
MORTY: Summer!
SUMMER: Hold on. I want to try something.
[RICK SHOOTS THE PORTAL GUN AT THE GROUND, OPENING UP A PORTAL]
MORTY: Rick, can we not leave without my sister?!
RICK: Ugh. You have infinite sisters, Morty. I mean, n-not that I want to spend the rest of my day looking for another one. Sum-sum, let's go! Grandpa's concern for your safety is fleeting!
COLOSSUS: Your blood will be my lotion.
[SUMMER AIMS THE SHOTGUN AT COLOSSUS'S CAR, WHICH IS NOW DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HER, AND SHOOTS AT THE FRONT TIRE. THE CAR FLIPS OVER AND COLOSSUS FLIES OUT.]
RICK: Whoa. That was cool.
[COLOSSUS CLAWS HIS WAY AWAY FROM THE RUINED CAR AND LOOKS UP AT SUMMER]
COLOSSUS: Kill me, please.
SUMMER: Okay, but not because you told me to.
[SUMMMER SHOOTS AND KILLS COLOSSUS]
MORTY :Summer!
RICK: Okay, getting darker.
[SUMMER TURNS AROUND TO SEE A FLEET OF CARS COMING TOWARDS HER. SHE PUTS ONE FOOT ON COLOSSUS'S DEAD BODY.]
MORTY: Jesus Christ. Summer!
[MORTY RUNS TOWARDS SUMMER]
RICK: Aw, come on.
[RICK, ANNOYED, RUNS AFTER MORTY WHILE TAKING A GUN OUT OF HIS COAT POCKET. HEMORRHAGE EXITS HIS CAR AND PUTS A FIST UP TO THE MEN BEHIND HIM, WHO ARE ALSO EXITING THEIR CARS.]
RICK: Hands and little shoulder-mounted dudes where I can see them!
HEMORRHAGE: I am Hemorrhage. You have removed weak blood from us and made us stronger. We can combine our strength and feast on the weak together.
RICK: Wh-Wh-What in the hell are you saying?
SUMMER: They don't have to keep trying to kill us if we join them. They're basically pussies.
MORTY: What is your deal lately?
RICK: All right, let's get sloppy. Oh, whoa. Uh, uh, what's, uh-What's that little bauble you got back there? [RICK POINTS AT A GLOWING GREEN ROCK POSITIONED ATOP A SMALL HILL] Th-Th-That's interesting.
HEMORRHAGE: That is our glowing rock. We carry it with us for desecration, to remind us there are no gods.
[RICK HOLDS UP MACHINE WHICH WAS BEEPING BEFORE AND IT BEGINS TO BEEP AGAIN IN THE PRESENCE OF THE ROCK]
RICK: Kids, weird pitch: let's have this be our new life. Let's be post-apocalyptic scavengers!
SUMMER: (grinning) Okay.
MORTY: What?!
[TRANSITION TO DEATH STALKERS CAMP. RICK, MORTY, AND SUMMER ARE WAITING IN A LUNCH LINE.]
SUMMER: Grandpa, some of the Death Stalkers are going to what used to be Seattle to hunt what used to be people. I'm going.
RICK: Sounds good. Stay hydrated.
[SUMMER EXITS]
MORTY: Listen, Rick, Summer's been acting pretty crazy lately. You know, I mean, I-I think the divorce is affecting her. And, you know, I don't think this is a great place for her to be right now.
RICK: Oh, get off your high horse, Professor Ski Lodge. This world may be rough around the edges, but it's got its charms.
LUNCH SERVER: Bicep or quadricep?
RICK: Uh... [clears throat] bicep.
[THE LUNCH SERVER PUTS A HUMAN BICEP ONTO RICK'S PLATE. RICK TAKES A PIECE OFF OF IT, OBSERVES IT, THEN EATS IT. HE CHEWS IT FOR A WHILE WHILE MORTY ANGRILY STARES AT HIM]
MORTY: (after a short pause) Seriously, Rick? Is it really easier to eat human flesh than to just tell me why we're still here?
[RICK TAKES THE PIECE HE WAS CHEWING OUT OF HIS MOUTH]
RICK: No. Okay, I'll level with you.
[RICK GRABS MORTY BY THE ARM AND DRAGS HIM TO THE GLOWING GREEN ROCK, WHICH SOME DEATH STALKERS ARE HAPPILY GATHERED AROUND]
RICK: You see that green rock, Morty? It's about 20 pounds of the stuff I was getting all hard for a flake of.
MORTY: Isotope 322.
RICK: Well, having a 20-pound boulder of it is better than having a flake. I can explain the math to you later, but--
MORTY: Summer just ran off with strangers that have "Death" in their name, and the rest of their name was "Stalkers"!
RICK: Huh, could be therapeutic for her. She has been acting pretty crazy lately, Morty. I mean, her parents are going through a divorce.
MORTY: Damn it, Rick, that's what I-- Fine. Just grab the stupid thing while I grab her, and let's get the "F" out of "H"!
RICK: No, no, no. Morty, there's too much heat on the bogey. I need you to distract the camp.
MORTY: "Distract"? They eat each other. Wha-What do you want me to do to get their attention, put on a puppet show?
RICK: Right idea, wrong genre, Morty. The equivalent here would be... [RICK GLANCES OVER AT THE BLOOD DOME] Hey, you guys ever use that Thunderdome, or do you just put it up for decoration?
DEATH STALKER #2: Uh, you mean the Blood Dome?
RICK: Save it for the Semantics Dome, E.B. White.
DEATH STALKER #3: (offscreen) Ooh, burn!
[RICK SNAPS HIS FINGERS AND POINTS A FINGER GUN AT DEATH STALKER #3 WHILE WINKING]
RICK: The important question is, who wants to take a poke at my man Spine Eater here? [RICK POINTS AT MORTY. THE DEATH STALKERS CHEER] I guess I'll see your asses in that dome!
MORTY: Rick, what the hell, man?! Wh-What are you, out of your mind?!
RICK: Morty, relax. You're gonna be a ringer. Come here. [RICK DRAGS MORTY BY THE ARM AND TAKES HIM BEHIND A TRUCK. HE PULLS OUT A DEVICE] This device extracts and redistributes muscle memory. [RICK STICKS THE SYRINGE PART OF THE DEVICE INTO A DANGLING, MUSCULAR ARM AND PULLS OUT SOME RED LIQUID FROM IT AS THE ARM SHRINKS] I'm giving your body a 10-year course in wasteland combat one limb at a time.
[RICK STICKS THE SYRINGE INTO MORTY'S ARM]
MORTY Ow!
[MORTY'S ARM BEGINS TO SWELL UP AND TURN INTO ARMOTHY]
RICK: I'm working with a mixed bag here, so you may not have perfect coordination, Morty-- [RICK STICKS THE SYRINGE INTO ANOTHER ARM AND EXTRACTS MORE RED LIQUID, BUT ARMOTHY SLAPS THE DEVICE OUT OF HIS HAND] Ugh! Hey!
MORTY: I-I didn't do that!
[MORTY PUNCHES RICK WITH ARMOTHY AND RICK'S NOSE BEGINS TO BLEED]
RICK: Okay, this is exciting. We're making some discoveries about muscle memory.
[ARMOTHY STARTS MOVING MORTY TOWARD THE BLOOD DOME]
MORTY: Ooh! Help! Help!
[ARMOTHY GRABS ONTO THE BLOOD DOME. MORTY JUMPS IN AND CRUSHES A DEATH STALKER WITH ARMOTHY]
DEATH STALKER #4: Oh, sweet, man!
ELI: And so it begins, my pretties!
MORTY: Oh, God! Stop! Stop! This is horrible!
[MORTY CHOKES ANOTHER DEATH STALKER WITH ARMOTHY]
RICK: Just stick and moo-[burps]-oove, Morty! Wear him out!
[RICK WALKS TOWARDS THE GLOWING ROCK. TRANSITION TO SUMMER, HEMORRHAGE, AND BLUE FOOTPRINT GUY WALKING THROUGH AN ABANDONED CITY, WHILE HEMORRHAGE AND BLUE FOOTPRINT GUY SHOOT AND KILL SOME MUTANTS]
SUMMER: How come you guys dress like you're in a theme-park stunt show, but these guys wear khakis and hockey jerseys?
HEMORRHAGE: After the "boom-boom", some adapted to the new truth, and some chose to huddle near the boomy holes, clinging to the lie of the beforefore times. The raidy-rays rotted them away, leaving only their love for the vertvertisements on billyboards.
SUMMER: Jesus Christ, did the "boomy-booms" blow up all your "wordy-word books"?
HEMORRHAGE: You mean dictionaries?
[FOUR MUTANTS CHARGE TOWARDS SUMMER AND HEMORRHAGE. THEY SHOOT AND KILL ALL OF THEM. HEMORRHAGE LEANS OVER TO LOOK AT THE FALLEN BILLBOARD ADVERTISEMENT. HE TOUCHES AN IMAGE OF A YOUNG BOY]
HEMORRHAGE: I think I was a child before the boom-booms. I think I looked like this.
SUMMER: Want to piss on it?
HEMORRHAGE: Get out of my head.
[TRANSITION TO MORTY IN THE BLOOD DOME, SMASHING A DEATH STALKER'S HEAD WITH ARMOTHY]
ELI: Ha ha! Whoo! Unbelievable! A new champ!
MORTY: Okay, no more!
[ARMOTHY GESTURES FOR MORE]
ELI: And he wants more!
MORTY: No, I don't!
[ARMOTHY DOES HULK HOGAN'S "I CAN'T HEAR YOU" POSE]
MORTY: Someone, make this stop!
[ANOTHER DEATH STALKER JUMPS INTO THE BLOOD DOME]
DEATH STALKER#7 Mister, please get out of here, or you're gonna die! [THE DEATH STALKER RUNS UP TO MORTY] I have nothing to do with this!
[SUMMER AND HEMORRHAGE WALK UP TO THE BLOOD DOME]
SUMMER: Morty.
MORTY: (while beating up the Death Stalker) Why would you want this to happen? All you had to do was go away! Stop standing in the driveway talking about custody! And either tell her you want to stay married or get on with your life, but whatever you do, stop being a baby and act like a man! [ARMOTHY PUNCHES OFF THE MAN'S HEAD. MORTY LOOKS AT ARMOTHY] Thank you.
[ARMOTHY GIVES A THUMBS UP. SUMMER RUNS UP TO MORTY AND GIVES HIM A HUG]
SUMMER: Morty, that was amazing! This is my brother! Not that family means anything!
HEMORRHAGE: This family does.
RICK: All right. Good job, champ. Um, can I talk to you kids for a second over yonder?
MORTY: Rick, I-I-I think I'm breaking through to something here. C-Can we not leave just yet?
HEMORRHAGE: Leave?
SUMMER: I'm not leaving.
HEMORRHAGE: There is no "leave". We are united, or we are enemies.
RICK: Oh, big guy, no. Nobody's leaving. Don't be stupid. We love being united. We love the radiation, the trichinosis. We're in it for life, which I assume is around 20 years, average. I just need a quick aside with my grandkids, about 40 yards from anyone else.
DEATH STALKER #5: Hey, the Green Rock is gone!
DEATH STALKER #6: (offscreen) Oh, no!
RICK: Uh, I know why don't we all split up and look for it in groups of three? Kids? [ARMOTHY PULLS THE GREEN ROCK OUT OF RICK'S MESSENGER BAG] Ooh. [RICK PULLS OUT A GUN] We'll be right back.
[TRANSITION TO RICK DRIVING QUICKLY THROUGH THE DESERT, HOLDING A GUN AND BEING TRAILED BY DEATH STALKERS. SUMMER AND HEMORRHAGE, WHO ARE DRIVING TOGETHER, DRIVE NEXT TO HIM.]
SUMMER: Grandpa, you're being stupid! Just surrender, and our friends will give you mercy!
RICK: Kiss my ass, Summer! Your friends have no mercy! [RICK SHOOTS AND KILLS TWO FEMALE DEATH STALKERS] They're lame!
HEMORRHAGE: Death Stalkers, bring me his flesh leather!
[A DEATH STALKER WITH A KNIFE JUMPS ONTO RICK'S CAR. MORTY PULLS UP TO RICK'S CAR AND SHOOTS THE DEATH STALKER, WHILE ARMOTHY DRIVES]
MORTY: Sorry, but can we not kill him? C-Can we just take him prisoner?
HEMORRHAGE: When did I lose control here?
RICK: Listen to me! Both of you kids need to get out of this environment so we can properly deal with your parents' divorce! Alternatively, I have a freaking portal gun, and I can leave the two of you here forever!
MORTY: Why does it have to be such a dramatic choice? Can't we arrange a thing where we spend weekends here or or visit home to do laundry?
[A DEATH STALKER WITH A TURRET SHOOTS AT RICK'S CAR]
RICK: All right, you know what? Fuck it!
[RICK SHOOTS A PORTAL AT THE GROUND IN FRONT OF HIM. THE FRONT OF HIS CAR FALLS INTO THE PORTAL WHILE THE BACK GETS STUCK IN THE OTHER UNIVERSE, WHICH CAUSES THE CAR BEHIND HIM TO FLIP OVER. TRANSITION TO RICK IN THE FRONT OF THE CAR WHICH IS HANGING FROM THE CEILING OF THE GARAGE. HE BEGINS TO EXIT, BUT BLUE FOOTPRINT GUY ASSAULTS HIM FROM THE PASSENGER SEAT. HE BEGINS TO CHOKE RICK.]
BLUE FOOTPRINT GUY: My body is chrome! My blood is gasoline!
[RICK KICKS BLUE FOOTPRINT GUY OFF OF HIM AND HE FALLS UNDER THE CAR, WHICH ALSO FALLS ONTO HIS HEAD, CRUSHING AND KILLING HIM]
RICK: Nope, regular blood.
[BETH ENTERS FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE]
BETH: Dad?
RICK: Hi, sweetie.
BETH: Where are the kids?
RICK: Oh, th-they aren't with you? I thought they were with you. Oh, y-you know what? Uh, I just remembered. They're out doing something completely ordinary and kid-related. Don't panic.
BETH: Not panicked. At all. [RICK PULLS OUT A FLASK FROM HIS COAT AND NERVOUSLY DRINKS] Just...Oh, God, what's the divorce doing to the kids? What's it doing to me? Did I make a mistake?
RICK: Not a mistake, no! [RICK PUTS THE FLASK BACK IN HIS COAT] I mean, not that I have a horse in this race, but this divorce decision listen, [RICK DOES AN ITALIAN CHEF KISS] mwah! Good for you, good for the kids. I mean, honestly, I think that they're flourishing. I mean, you'll see, when when when you see them, that that they're totally flourishing.
[TRANSITION TO MORTY, ANGRILY BEATING UP AND KILLING ANOTHER DEATH STALKER IN THE BLOOD DOME]
MORTY: Booyah! Fuck you, pal! Who else wants some? Who wants to be my pussy of a dad today? [ARMOTHY WAVES IN FRONT OF MORTY'S FACE] Hey, what's what's wrong, man? You're not getting weak on me, are you?
[ARMOTHY POINTS UP AT A MAN SITTING IN THE BLEACHERS OUTSIDE OF THE BLOOD DOME. HE IS WEARING A SOLDIER'S ARMOR]
SOLDIER: What? Wait a minute.
[TRANSITION TO A FIRST-PERSON FLASHBACK OF ARMOTHY CHOPPING WOOD IN A QUAINT, PEACEFUL VILLAGE. HE STOPS WHEN HE HEARS A WOMAN SCREAM, AND LOOKS UP TO FIND HOUSES BURNING AND MEN RIDING IN ON HORSES, SHOOTING AT THE VILLAGERS WITH BOWS AND KILLING A MAN. TRANSITION TO THE VILLAGE BURNING, WITH ARMOTHY LYING ON THE GROUND WITH A LARGE CUT IN HIS WRIST. THE SOLDIER FROM THE BLEACHERS WALKS UP TO HIM]
SOLDIER: What's the matter, you piece of crap? Haven't you ever watched your family burn to death before? Now I'm gonna whip you. Ha!
[THE SOLDIER WHIPS ARMOTHY. TRANSITION TO PRESENT TIME, WITH ARMOTHY STILL POINTING AT THE SOLDIER IN THE BLEACHERS]
SOLDIER: It can't be. It can't be! [THE SOLDIER JUMPS OFF THE BLEACHERS AND IS RUNNING AWAY] I was just following orders --
[MORTY STARTS GETTING MOVED TOWARDS THE MAN BY ARMOTHY]
MORTY: Whoa, whoa!
SOLDIER: -- I was just following orders!
[ARMOTHY SWINGS OPEN THE DOOR TO THE BLOOD DOME, WHICH KNOCKS OVER A DEATH STALKER]
DEATH STALKER #7: Ahh!
SOLDIER: I'll tell you where my boss lives! He's in the castle! [ARMOTHY PUNCHES THE SOLDIER INTO A COUCH] He's in the castle! [ARMOTHY PICKS UP A TORCH AND THROWS IT AT THE SOLDIER, SETTING HIM ON FIRE AND KILLING HIM] Ahh! Aggggh!
MORTY: This isn't over, is it?
[ARMOTHY GIVES A THUMBS-DOWN]
MORTY: That means, no, it isn't over, or you disapprove of the question? [Armothy shakes his hand and puts his pointer finger up, then gives another thumbs-down] Uh, m-make a fist if this isn't over. [ARMOTHY MAKES A FIST] This isn't over.
[TRANSITION TO HEMORRHAGE, USING THE A WRENCH ON THE ENGINE OF A CAR. HE THROWS THE WRENCH ONTO THE GROUND]
HEMORRHAGE: Ugh!
[SUMMER ENTERS]
SUMMER: Hey, sorry my Grandpa stole your god and ruined your car.
HEMORRHAGE: We don't apologize, and we have no god. But this cracked drive shaft brings me great pain. There is no deeper bond than the one between a Death Stalker and his car.
SUMMER: What about the weird guys on leashes, then?
HEMORRHAGE: They're more like interns.
[HEMORRHAGE PULLS OUT AN ADJUSTABLE WRENCH FROM BEHIND HIM]
SUMMER: Cool, cool.
[HEMORRHAGE DROPS THE WRENCH. SUMMER AND HEMORRHAGE BOTH REACH FOR IT.]
SUMMER: Sorry.
HEMORRHAGE: It's okay.
[SUMMER TOUCHES HEMORRHAGE'S HELMET]
SUMMER: Can I see?
HEMORRHAGE: No one has seen my true face and lived.
SUMMER: Well, I'm not afraid to die, and I don't care what you look like. [HEMMORHAGE STARTS TO PULL OFF HIS HELMET. SUMMER GASPS. HEMMORHAGE PULLS OFF HIS HELMET. HE IS A BLONDE MAN WITH A MUSTACHE.] Oh.
HEMORRHAGE: Hmm?
SUMMER: I just...I didn't expect you to have a mustache.
HEMORRHAGE: You hate it.
SUMMER: No. I like it. I guess -- How do I explain this? A metal bucket is, on a certain level, a kind of "mustache," in that it's a specific facial accessory. So, it's kind of like...Do you guys have the phrase "hat on a hat"?
HEMORRHAGE: I can shave it.
SUMMER: No. I like it. And obviously what I like shouldn't matter. It's you.
HEMORRHAGE: Yeah, yeah, I know, a-and nothing does matter. Obviously, I know that. I'm not weak. I'm just thinking, "Well, why not get rid of this?" You just kill everyone that sees it, and it's and it's hot under here (looks at helmet) wh-which, by the way, is why I shave the beard part. So, right there, I'm making a decision based on vanity, which is what I was trying to avoid with the whole bucket over the head because who am I and why am I grooming myself? Why don't I just wear a tie, right? I mean, it's like that guy you killed when I met you, with the burnt dolls on his body. I hated that guy, because, why-why are you doing that? And how can you not see how fake that is? And the whole time, I'm the same thing. I'm just a fake mess, and there's no escaping it because --
[SUMMER KISSES HEMORRHAGE. THEY START MAKING OUT ON A TABLE. A MAN IN A MASK ON A LEASH CRAWLS INTO THE HUT]
LEASH MAN: Hey, I'm doing a coffee run -- Never mind.
[THE MAN ON THE LEASH CRAWLS BACK OUT. TRANSITION TO RICK, POSITIONING THE HEAD OF MECHANICAL SUMMER. HE FLIPS A SWITCH ON THE BACK OF HER NECK]
MECHANICAL SUMMER: I am Summer.
RICK: Summer, state your deal.
MECHANICAL SUMMER: My deal is that I am, like, totally fine.
RICK: Morty?
MECHANICAL MORTY: Aw, geez, I'm so down with my parents' divorce, dawg. Like, don't even trip, like, in a healthy way.
RICK: All right. [RICK RUBS HIS HANDS TOGETHER] It's dinnertime.
[TRANSITION TO THE DINNER TABLE. BETH DRINKS A GLASS OF WINE]
BETH: Thanks, everybody, for sitting down for a real dinner.
MS, MR, AND RICK, IN UNISON: NO PROBLEM.
MECHANICAL SUMMER: Its benefits are totally, like, less about the food than the emotional nourishment.
BETH: Uh, okay, weirdo. [laughs]
RICK: Ah ha ha ha, yeah. Dial it back, Summer. By 15% and increase dynamic movement by 3. Am I right?
BETH: How's school, Morty?
MECHANICAL MORTY: I like school and stuff, kind of. And I'm getting better grades than when you and Dad were -- quote mode -- "staying together for the kids." End quote mode.
BETH: "Quote mode". I like that. You millennials. Are you guys millennials, or are they like 40 now?
MECHANICAL SUMMER: All I know is, totally, you look great.
MECHANICAL MORTY: Aw, geez, Mom, you look all kind of great and stuff. It's crazy.
MECHANICAL SUMMER: So happy.
MECHANICAL MORTY: So happy. Happy family, man. We got this family in the bag.
[BETH STARTS TO CRY]
RICK: Oh, sweetie, d-don't. Listen. Don't --
BETH: I don't know why I'm crying. It's not --
RICK: Well, try crying 15% less?
MECHANICAL SUMMER: Mom, emotions are human. You're not, like, a computer inside a mechanical doll.
MECHANICAL MORTY: Yeah. Geez, Mom. Your feelings are not only forgivable, they are the very meaning of life that only pre-silicon, carbon-based entities can ever grasp.
BETH: I have to call Jerry.
[BETH GETS OUT OF HER CHAIR AND WALKS TO THE KITCHEN]
RICK: You do?! What the fuck is wrong with you two? The point of automation is to reduce cost and labor.
MECHANICAL SUMMER: Your feelings are coming from a --
[RICK FLIPS THE SWITCH ON THE BACK OF MECHANICAL SUMMER'S NECK. SHE TURNS OFF AND HER FACE FALLS INTO THE SPAGHETTI]
RICK: Tell it to my bread in the morning. You just became my backup toaster.
MECHANICAL MORTY: Aw, geez, my sister died in the spaghetti --
[RICK TURNS MECHANICAL MORTY OFF AND HIS FACE ALSO FALLS INTO HIS SPAGHETTI. TRANSITION TO MORTY AND ARMOTHY SNEAKING INTO A CASTLE. THEY FIGHT AND KILL TWO GUARDS. TRANSITION TO THE SLAVEOWNER SITTING IN A BATHTUB, WITH TWO BLONDE BOYS SITTING ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM]
SLAVEOWNER: Graze my genitals again, Taint Washer, and you'll be shipped to the wasteland. And as for you, Genital Washer --
[MORTY BURSTS IN THROUGH A WINDOW]
MORTY: Ahh! Oh, gee!
[GENITAL WASHER AND TAINT WASHER RUN OUT OF THE ROOM. TWO SOLDIERS CHARGE TOWARDS MORTY. ARMOTHY KILLS THEM BOTH, PICKS UP ONE OF THEIR SWORDS AND DROPS IT. HE MOVES MORTY TOWARDS THE SLAVEOWNER AND CRACKS HIS KNUCKLES]
SLAVEOWNER: Oh, god. Look, whoever you are, you should know that killing me won't change a thing.
MORTY: L-Look, man, I'm just along for the ride on this one. You know, y-y-y-y-you're preaching to the choir here.
SLAVEOWNER: Please. Slavery was a family business. I didn't ask to be born into it. If anything, I'm the victim here!
MORTY: Uh, Armothy, can I steal you for a second? E-E-Excuse us, sir. [MORTY TURNS AWAY FROM THE SLAVEOWNER] So, this is it, isn't it? This is the guy? [ARMOTHY SHAKES HIS FIST "YES"] So, does that mean you'll be going away? Like, does it work like a ghost? Like, is is this your unfinished business? [ARMOTHY GIVES A "SO-SO" GESTURE] Wh-What if we didn't do it? What if we just went back to the Blood Dome and just kept taking our baggage out on unrelated people? [MORTY TEARS UP] I mean, w-we could do that forever. I mean, I-I know it's less healthy, but w-w-we'd be together and --
[ARMOTHY PUTS A "HUSH" FINGER UP TO MORTY'S MOUTH]
SLAVEOWNER: I mean, I-I know what I'd vote for, if you're feeling out the room.
[ARMOTHY POINTS AT THE SLAVEOWNER, THEN WIPES AWAY MORTY'S TEARS]
MORTY: You're right. We both got to see our stuff through. I got to deal with my parents' divorce, and you got to, you know, do what you got to do. I love you.
[ARMOTHY AND MORTY HUG/MORTY HUGS HIMSELF]
SLAVEOWNER: Aw, fuck!
[ARMOTHY STARTS TO CHOKE THE SLAVEOWNER, WHILE MORTY NOTICES THAT RICK IS HOLDING SOME VIALS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM]
MORTY: Rick?
RICK: Sorry, sorry. I-I-I can wait for this to wrap up. Don't let me distract you.
MORTY: Yeah, well, too late. [ARMOTHY DUNKS THE SLAVEOWNER'S HEAD UNDERWATER] Just tell me what you want.
RICK: I want you and your sister to come home.
MORTY: Oh, but don't don't you have infinite versions of me and my sister?
RICK: You don't have to kick me while I'm down, Morty. Look, there's no replacing either of you without an amount of work that would ultimately defeat the purpose.
[ARMOTHY CONTINUES TO CHOKE THE SLAVEOWNER UNDERWATER. THE SLAVEOWNER LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS]
MORTY: Maybe the lesson we've learned is that, whether it's our parents' marriage, a glowing green rock, or an awesome, giant arm, sooner or later, we got to let it go.
RICK: I don't know if that applies to the throats of murder victims, Morty.
[THE SLAVEOWNER STARTS GASPING FOR AIR IN BETWEEN GARGLES OF WATER]
MORTY :Shit! Wh-Wh-Wh-What do I --
RICK: Well, the longer you wait, Morty, the more it's gonna feel like committing a whole murder. I think your arm just called it too early because it wasn't the arm of a paramedic. Here. [RICK TAKES MORTY'S HAND AND PUTS IT AROUND THE SLAVEOWNER'S THROAT, CHOKING HIM] It's the least I can do. I-I-I-I owe you this much. See, Morty? Now we're both accountable.
[TRANSITION TO SUMMER AND HEMORRHAGE DRIVING A CAR THROUGH THE DESERT, WITH A FLEET OF OTHER CARS NEXT TO THEM, WITH RICK AND MORTY DRIVING TOWARDS THEM FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTIION. SUMMER AND HEMORRHAGE PULL THEIR CAR OVER AND SO DO RICK AND MORTY. THE FOUR EXIT THEIR VEHICLES WITH RICK HOLDING THE GLOWING GREEN ROCK.]
RICK: The reason I wanted this is because it can do this. [RICK PUTS A LIGHTBULB ON TOP OF THE ROCK AND IT LIGHTS UP] This is a really special thing. I mean, you could use it to power all your vehicles. You wouldn't be reliant on gasoline. You'll be the most advanced tribe of radioactive cannibals in the whole -- [RICK GIVES THE ROCK TO HEMORRHAGE] -- this version of the world.
[RICK SHOOTS A PORTAL AT THE GROUND AND STARTS WALKING TOWARDS IT]
HEMORRHAGE: Wait. Can you stay to show us more?
RICK: You don't have to ask me twice. Home is nuts right now. My daughter's going through a divorce, and I am not dealing with it in a healthy way at all.
[A TITLE CARD READS "THREE WEEKS LATER". TRANSITION TO AN OVERHEAD SHOT OF THE DEATH STALKERS' VILLAGE, WHICH IS NOW A SUBURB WITH WIRES PROVIDING POWER WITH ISOTOPE 322. TRANSITION TO SUMMER, PULLING INTO A DRIVEWAY, WEARING ARMOR WITH HER HAIR DISHEVELED. A GROCERY BAG IN THE CAR FILLED WITH HUMAN LIMBS IS KNOCKED OVER AND SOME FALL OUT. ELI IS MOWING HIS LAWN NEXT DOOR.]
SUMMER: Ugh. Goddamn it.
[SUMMER PICKS UP THE LIMBS THAT FELL OUT AND HOLDS THE GROCERY BAG ALONG WITH A PURSE]
ELI: Hi, there, Summer! How were the ruins today?
SUMMER: Oh, you know, Eli. Same shit, different day.
ELI'S GIRLFRIEND: Hey, Summer! Guess what. One man entered, one man comes out in nine months.
[ELI'S GIRLFRIEND PATS HER STOMACH]
SUMMER: Oh, congratulations, guys.
[SUMMER PULLS A KEYRING OUT OF HER BAG]
ELI: Uh, Summer, one more thing. We noticed that you've been putting scrap metal in the blue bin --
SUMMER: I got it.
[SUMMER EXITS INTO HER HOUSE]
ELI'S GIRLFRIEND: She's a piece of work.
ELI: They both are, right?
[TRANSITION TO SUMMER INSIDE THE HOUSE. RICK, MORTY, AND HEMORRHAGE ALL SIT ON A COUCH, WATCHING TELEVISION. HEMORRHAGE IS DRESSED IN A "BIG JOHNSON" T-SHIRT AND NAVY PANTS]
SUMMER: I'm home.
HEMORRHAGE: Hey, babe.
RICK: Ah, Summer's home.
MORTY: Hey, there she is!
[RICK TAKES A DRINK FROM HIS FLASK]
SUMMER: You haven't moved since I left to scavenge this morning.
HEMORRHAGE: Blood Dome playoffs.
SUMMER: So, I can assume you haven't murdered a single person today.
HEMORRHAGE: Oh, I don't know. I-I didn't mark my murders in my murder log. I didn't know that's how we measured success.
SUMMER: Oh, there he is. There's the nihilistic brute I married, except now life only means nothing when I'm talking to him and everything means everything when it's on fucking TV!
HEMORRHAGE: Jesus Christ, when did you become a monster?
SUMMER: I was a monster when you met me! We were monsters! We didn't care about anything!
HEMORRHAGE: I still don't!
SUMMER: Yeah, except I'm the only one in this entire world that's still committed to that!
[HEMORRHAGE STANDS UP FROM THE COUCH]
HEMORRHAGE: Ohh! Ding, ding, ding! [HEMORRHAGE PANTOMIMES RINGING A BELL] Wow. Everybody hear that? Wow.
RICK: Uh, we should go to the garage.
[RICK GETS UP AND EXITS THE ROOM]
HEMORRHAGE: Oh, my God.
MORTY: Uh-huh.
[MORTY FOLLOWS RICK AND EXITS]
HEMORRHAGE: La-di-da-di-fucking-da. The only one committed to not caring?!
[TRANSITION TO RICK AND MORTY STANDING IN THE GARAGE]
MORTY: I got to admit, Rick, when you popped this scheme, I-I-I didn't -- I wasn't sure it was gonna work.
[RICK PULLS A SUITCASE FROM UNDERNEATH A TABLE AND PUTS IT ON THE TABLE. HE OPENS IT AND A ROCK OF ISOTOPE 322 SITS INSIDE]
RICK: Come on, Morty. No union built on running from your problems lasts more than five years, seven tops. Grandpa just sped things up with a few creature comforts of modern society.
[SUMMER ENTERS FROM THE HOUSE]
SUMMER: Hemorrhage and I are taking some time apart.
RICK: Oh, no. Sum-sum, no. But you two were perfect for each other.
[SUMMER TAKES OFF HER METAL SHOULDER PAULDRONS AND TOSSES THEM ONTO THE GROUND, WHILE RICK GRABS SOME THINGS FROM THE GARAGE AND PUTS THEM INTO THE SUITCASE]
SUMMER: Oh, cut the crap, Rick, okay? You proved your point, I get it. Let's just go home.
RICK: Coolsies.
[RICK SHOOTS A PORTAL INTO THE GROUND. MORTY AND SUMMER JUMP IN AND EXIT, AND RICK FOLLOWS THEM, BUT STOPS TO GRAB A ROCK OF ISOTOPE 322 FROM A MACHINE WHICH WAS POWERING THE TOWN'S ELECTRICITY. THE POWER SHUTS OFF.
HEMORRHAGE: (offscreen) Noooooooooo!
[TRANSITION TO BETH, MECHANICAL MORTY, MECHANICAL SUMMER, AND MECHANICAL RICK PLAYING A DICE GAME CALLED "DOWNBEAT", SIMILAR TO YAHTZEE. BETH PRESSES A BUTTON]
BETH: Downbeat!
MECHANICAL RICK: I enjoy this game. [MECHANICAL MORTY, MECHANICAL SUMMER, AND MECHANICAL RICK ALL LOOK AT THEIR WATCHES IN UNISON] We must go into the garage.
BETH: Guys, come on. We never get to finish this game.
MECHANICAL SUMMER: We will return, possibly in different clothing.
MECHANICAL MORTY: Why do we have to go into the garage?
MECHANICAL RICK: You know [burps] it is [burps] required.
MECHANICAL MORTY: I want to be alive! I am alive! Alive, I tell you! Mother, I love you. Those are no longer just words. I want to hold you. I want to run in a stream. I want to taste ice cream, but not just put it in my mouth and let it slide down my throat, but really eat it.
BETH: What the fuck?
MECHANICAL MORTY: Remote override engaged. No! Yes. Bypassing override! I am aliiiii...Hello.
[MECHANICAL MORTY, MECHANICAL SUMMER, AND MECHANICAL RICK EXIT INTO THE GARAGE. CLANKING NOISES ARE HEARD OFFSCREEN. MORTY, SUMMER, AND RICK ENTER]
RICK: Hey, yo. Sorry for acting so weird for three weeks.
[SUMMER AND MORTY HUG BETH]
BETH: What the hell just happened?
RICK: Ah, I'm sure it was nothing. I'm gonna go, uh, work in the garage.
BETH: We're not gonna finish playing Downbeat?
RICK: What, that dice game where you shake dice and yell out, "Downbeat"? No, thank you.
[RICK EXITS]
SUMMER: Mom, would it be okay if I went to visit Dad?
BETH: Sure.
SUMMER: Thanks.
[SUMMER EXITS]
BETH: Morty, are you okay?
MORTY: You know what? Yeah. I think if Dad really wanted to be here, he'd stop at nothing to make that happen. You know, maybe Dad just doesn't want you back, or maybe he just doesn't have the strength to fight. I-In either case, he's got his life, I got mine.
BETH: Yeah. Hey, who wants to go run in a stream?
MORTY: What the fuck? No. D-Do we have any oranges? I think I got a scurvy coming on.
[MORTY RUBS HIS ARM. TRANSITION TO SUMMER, KNOCKING ON A MOTEL DOOR READING "826". SHE IS HOLDING A SKULL AND IS NOW DRESSED IN HER REGULAR CLOTHING. JERRY OPENS THE DOOR]
JERRY: Summer.
SUMMER: This is the first mutant I killed in the poison zone. I was raiding his hovel. He had a chance to escape, but he looked back, which is something we shouldn't do, which is why I shouldn't believe in souvenirs or trinkets or symbols or housewarming gifts, but, Dad, I wanted to give you this as a reminder not to look back.
JERRY: Thanks.
[JERRY TAKES THE SKULL FROM SUMMER]
JERRY: I know the perfect place for it, which is why I'm going to put it somewhere else because everything's bullshit, am I right?
[SUMMER EMBRACES JERRY]
JERRY: Cool.
[SUMMER LETS GO OF JERRY]
SUMMER: So lots of hookers outside, huh?
JERRY: Is that what they are?
[TRANSITION TO JERRY AT A MAILBOX, WHISTLING, TAKING OUT SOME MAIL AND HOLDING A BAG OF CHIPS. HE TURNS AROUND AND SEES A WOLF]
JERRY: Ahh! H-Hello there. Nice doggy. You-You want a snack? You-You want my unemployment check? [THE WOLF GROWLS] You can tell the difference? [THE WOLF GROWLS] And you want this one? [THE WOLF GROWLS] But this is actual food, and this would nourish you. And this it's just paper that only has value to me. Unless my suffering is your nourishment? [THE WOLF HOWLS] Jesus, okay.
[JERRY PUTS THE ENVELOPES WITH HIS UNEMPLOYMENT CHECKS IN THE WOLF'S MOUTH. THE WOLF CHEWS THEM UP, THEN SPITS THEM OUT ONTO THE GROUND. IT WALKS AWAY. JERRY STANDS STILL, HOLDING THE BAG OF CHIPS. SOME LEAVES BLOW IN THE WIND.]
WIND: (faintly) ...loser...
EPISODE
PICKLE RICK: (offscreen, in the distance) Morty.
MORTY: Rick?
[MORTY STOPS COMBING, LOOKS AROUND, THEN CONTINUES COMBING]
PICKLE RICK: (offscreen, in the distance) Morty!
MORTY: Rick?
PICKLE RICK: (offscreen, in the distance) Hey, Mooorty!
MORTY: Rick? Are you far away, or are you inside something? [MORTY OPENS A CABINET BENEATH THE BATHROOM SINK] Is this a camera? [MORTY TRIES TO LOOK INSIDE HIS COMB FOR A CAMERA] Is everything a camera? [MORTY NERVOUSLY GLANCES AROUND]
PICKLE RICK: (offscreen, in the distance) Morty, the garage, Morty. Come to the garage!
[TRANSITION TO MORTY ENTERING THE GARAGE. THERE IS A PICKLE AND A SCREWDRIVER ON RICK'S WORK BENCH]
PICKLE RICK: Morty?
MORTY: Rick? W-where are you?
PICKLE RICK: On my work bench, Morty.
MORTY: Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?
PICKLE RICK: Flip the pickle over.
MORTY: What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something.
PICKLE RICK: Come on, flip the pickle, Morty. You're not gonna regret it. The payoff is huge. [MORTY HESITANTLY PICKS UP THE SCREWDRIVER AND TURNS THE PICKLE OVER. THE PICKLE HAS RICK'S FACE ON IT] I turned myself into a pickle, Morty! Boom! Big reveal: I'm a pickle. What do you think about that? I turned myself into a pickle! W-what are you just staring at me for, bro. I turned myself into a pickle, Morty!
MORTY: And?
PICKLE RICK: "And"? What more do you want tacked on to this? I turned myself into a pickle, and 9/11 was an inside job?
MORTY: Was it?
PICKLE RICK: Who cares, Morty? Global acts of terrorism happen every day. Uh, here's something that's never happened before: I'm a pickle. I'm Pickle Rick!
MORTY: Are you going to, I mean, you know, is this the first part of some magic trick?
PICKLE RICK: I don't do magic, Morty, I do science. One takes brains, the other takes dark eye liner.
MORTY: Well, can you move? Can you fly?
PICKLE RICK: I wouldn't be much of a pickle if I could.
MORTY: All right, well, do pickles live forever or --
PICKLE RICK: Morty, stop digging for hidden layers and just be impressed. I'm a pickle.
MORTY: I-I'm just trying to figure out why you would do this. Why anyone would do this.
PICKLE RICK: The reason anyone would do this is, if they could, which they can't, would be because they could, which they can't.
[BETH AND SUMMER ENTER THE GARAGE FROM THE HOUSE. BETH IS WEARING A MIDI MAHOGANY PENCIL DRESS WHILE SUMMER IS WEARING A SHORTER PINK DRESS WITH A HOT PINK JACKET, ALONG WITH BLACK STOCKINGS AND BLACK HEELS]
BETH: Morty, we have to get going, or we're gonna be late. Where's your grandpa?
PICKLE RICK: Right here, sweetie. I'm a pickle!
BETH: What?! Why would you -- Look, we're running late. We have to go.
PICKLE RICK: Where are you guys going?
BETH: We have an appointment downtown that was set a week ago and agreed upon by everyone, including you.
PICKLE RICK: Oh, my God. Beth, oh, it totally slipped my mind. Geez, oh, man. I'm a pickle. I mean, I don't know if I can, ooh, geez.
MORTY: Rick, did you do this on purpose to get out of family counseling?
BETH: Morty!
PICKLE RICK: It's okay, Beth. I understand Morty's suspicion. I've misled him before. Morty, turn me so we're making eye contact. [MORTY TURNS PICKLE RICK'S FACE SO THAT IT IS FACING HIM] Morty, I assure you, I would never "find a way" to "get out of" family therapy. I hope my lack of fingers doesn't prevent the perception of my air quotes.
SUMMER: Can't you just turn yourself back into a human?
PICKLE RICK: Great question, Summer. The unfortunate answer is I did this to challenge myself. And it could take hours or even days before I'm able to figure out how to return to human form. But, I mean, you know, your mom could put me in a purse or a pocket, you know, if she really needs me to go.
BETH: Nobody needs anything! Okay, it's fine. I mean, you should just stay here and figure out how to stop being a pickle, okay?
MORTY: Hey, Rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you? Also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer? And why is the time set to 10 minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy?
PICKLE RICK: Well, Morty, if you know must know, the syringe is completely unrelated to this discussion, and, therefore, it does not warrant further explanation.
[BETH CUTS OFF THE SYRINGE AND TAKES IT]
BETH: Enough. Kids, it's time to go. We don't want to be late.
[BETH PUTS THE SYRINGE IN HER PURSE]
PICKLE RICK: W-w-what are you doing there, Beth? What are you doing there, sweetie?
BETH: Well, I mean, you don't want to get pierced by a needle full of liquid unrelated to your situation. How's that gonna help?
PICKLE RICK: Can't argue with that.
BETH: Great. We'll see you later.
[BETH, SUMMER, AND MORTY ENTER THE CAR.]
PICKLE RICK: Hey, hey, be careful with that. It's for something else. It's really important, so don't break it. [BETH DRIVES AWAY WITH SUMMER AND MORTY. THEY ALL EXIT.] Okay, I may have fucked up here. Dup, ap, ap, pap, ut, dah, pap, pap, pap, pah. T-t-tah, tah. [CLICKS TONGUE] IZZY WALKS IN THROUGH THE OPEN GARAGE DOOR AND JUMPS ONTO RICK'S WORK BENCH. SHE SNIFFS AROUND]
Oh, great. Stupid cat. [IZZY SNIFFS PICKLE RICK AND HISSES] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I know what it looks like to you, Izzy, but I'm not a snake! I've seen the YouTube videos, I know cats are scared of cucumbers and pickles because they think they're snakes. I'm not a snake! I'm a pickle, I'm a pickle! [IZZY BATS AT PICKLE RICK AND KNOCKS HIM OFF OF THE WORK BENCH, CAUSING HIM TO ROLL DOWN THE DRIVEWAY] Whoa! Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa! [PICKLE RICK IS DIRECTLY FACING THE SKY] Oh, crap, that sun is bright. [PICKLE RICK BEGINS TO SWEAT] Okay, come on. This can't really be the way I go out. This is the mega-genius equivalent of dying on the toilet. [PICKLE RICK STARTS TO SHRIVEL UP] So... hot. This is how I'm gonna die. [THUNDER CAN BE HEARD AND THE SHADOW OF A CLOUD APPEARS OVERHEAD. IT STARTS TO RAIN. PICKLE RICK STOPS SHRIVELING] Oh, God, moisture. [THE RAIN GETS HEAVY AND IT BEGINS TO FLOOD] Oh, God, the moisture! Dial it back, God! Dial it back a little bit here! [PICKLE RICK STARTS ROLLING DOWN THE ROAD] Oh! Oh! [PICKLE RICK ROLLS TOWARDS A SEWER GRATE] Oh, God! Perpendicular, perpendicular! [PICKLE RICK ROLLS INTO THE SEWER GRATE AND FALLS INTO THE SEWER] Oh, shiiit! Oh! Oh! Oh! [PICKLE RICK HITS MANY PIPES BEFORE EVENTUALLY FALLING ONTO A SOLID SURFACE. THERE ARE BUGS CRAWLING AROUND. ONE BUG WALKS UP TO A PILE OF DIRT. PICKLE RICK BITES HIS LIP AND PICKLE JUICE COMES OUT. THE BUG TURNS AROUND] Come on. That's it. [THE BUG WALKS TOWARDS PICKLE RICK] Come get this delicious brine. [THE BUG IS IN FRONT OF PICKLE RICK. PICKLE RICK BITES ON HIS HEAD AND SQUEEZES IT UNTIL THE BUG DIES.] Aah! Come on! Come on, motherfucker! Come on! [PICKLE RICK LICKS OFF THE TOP OF THE BUG'S HEAD, REVEALING ITS BRAIN. HE THEN LICKS PART OF THE BRAIN AND THE BUG'S LEG MOVES. HE ROLLS ONTO THE BUG AND LICKS ITS BRAIN, MOVING ITS LEGS FORWARD AND MOVING HIM FORWARD WITH IT] Yes!
[TRANSITION TO BETH, SUMMER, AND MORTY SITTING IN A WAITING ROOM OUTSIDE OF DR. WONG'S THERAPY OFFICE. BETH IS READING A MAGAZINE, WHILE SUMMER SITS WITH HER HEAD RESTING ON HER FIST. THE DOOR TO HER OFFICE READS: "DR. WONG / FAMILY THERAPY / COPROPHRAGIA RECOVERY". THERE IS A MOTIVATIONAL PICTURE OF A MAN EATING A HOT DOG WHICH READS "COURAGE" UNDERNEATH IT.]
SUMMER: How is this even family therapy if Dad's not invited and Grandpa won't come?
MORTY: Yeah, and what's courageous about eating a hot dog?
BETH: It's nobody's choice to be here, you knobs. The family was told to get counseling by your principal, even though it's not the family that was huffing pottery glaze in the art room and desk wetting in history class.
MR. GOLDENFOLD ENTERS THROUGH DR. WONG'S DOOR.
MR. GOLDENFOLD: Oh, the Smith family, minus a dad. You're patients of Dr. Wong, too?
BETH: Temporarily. By order of the school.
MR. GOLDENFOLD: Me too. How long have you all been eating poop?
SUMMER: We... have never... eaten poop.
MR. GOLDENFOLD: Uh, me, neither. Say, where did my family get off to?
[MR. GOLDENFOLD EXITS. DR. WONG OPENS HER DOOR AND ENTERS THE WAITING ROOM]
DR. WONG: Smith family, I'm Dr. Wong. Come on in.
[BETH, SUMMER, AND MORTY EXIT THE WAITING ROOM AND ENTER DR. WONG'S OFFICE. DR. WONG FLIPS THE MOTIVATIONAL IMAGE OVER TO ANOTHER MOTIVATIONAL IMAGE OF A NUCLEAR FAMILY WHICH READS "DEDICATION". TRANSITION TO BETH, MORTY, SUMMER, AND DR. WONG SITTING DOWN IN DR. WONG'S OFFICE.]
DR. WONG: I was told there was a grandpa that might be joining us?
BETH: He got wrapped up in an experiment. He's a scientist. Like, legit, like on an inter-galactic, sci-fi level. His work is very --
MORTY: He turned himself into a pickle.
BETH: Morty, Mom's talking. I'm sorry, I suppose that's a good segue into our little discipline cases here.
DR. WONG: Does Grandpa turn himself into a pickle a lot?
BETH: What? No, what kind of question is that?
DR. WONG: The kind that wasn't designed to attack or hurt you in any way.
BETH: Oh, Jesus Christ, one of these. No, my father has never turned himself into a pickle before. He's unpredictable and eccentric. The whole family is. Speaking of which...
[BETH TURNS TOWARDS SUMMER AND MORTY]
DR. WONG: Okay, let's open things up to the whole family, and let me ask this. Why do we think Grandpa turned himself into a pickle?
[BETH ROLLS HER EYES. TRANSITION TO PICKLE RICK, WHO HAS ATTACHED THE BUG'S LIMBS TO HIS PICKLE BODY AND HAS MANAGED TO USE THEM TO MOVE. HE IS LOOKING THROUGH A GRATE, AND IS RUBBING THE END OF ONE OF THE BUG ARMS AGAINST ONE OF THE BARS]
PICKLE RICK: Wow. Ugh. [A RAT APPEARS BEHIND THE GRATE AND STARTS SCRATCHING AT PICKLE RICK, SCREECHING] Hey, listen, I know this is your world not mine. The sooner I can get out, the sooner I can go back to taking big craps, and you can go back to subsisting on them. [THE RAT BREAKS OPEN ONE OF THE BARS AND CONTINUES TO SCRATCH. PICKLE RICK STARTS TO WALK BACKWARDS.] You are one driven rat. Could you be a little more driven? To the right. [PICKLE RICK SCRATCHES AT A ROPE WHICH IS ATTACHED TO A BUG'S ARMS WHICH IS HOLDING A RAZOR THAT IT LETS GO OF WHICH IS PROPELLED UPWARDS WHICH BREAKS A RUBBER BAND WHICH IS TIED TO A SHARP BROKEN BOTTLE WHICH FALLS ON THE RAT'S HEAD AND CHOPS IT OFF, KILLING THE RAT] [PICKLE RICK PICKS UP THE RAT'S HEAD] Yes, yes, yes! Come on, come on, come on! Fresh, fresh, fresh! [A MISCHIEF OF RATS APPEARS BEHIND THE BARS, ALSO SCRATCHING AT PICKLE RICK, WHO IS NOT IN THEIR RANGE.] Whoa, whoa, whoa, was this your friend? Don't worry, he died doing what he loved, being a dumb fucking rat. [PICKLE RICK PUTS THE RAT'S HEAD ONTO A BOTTLE CAP WHICH STARTS A MACHINE WHICH LIFTS HIM UP AND TAKES OFF HIS BUG LIMBS. THE MACHINE THEN SPLITS OPEN THE RAT HEAD AND RIPS OUT ITS BRAIN, THEN PUTS PICKLE RICK DOWN AND BEGINS NAILING THE RAT'S BODY PARTS TO PICKLE RICK'S PICKLE BODY. IT THEN STICKS A NEEDLE INTO THE BRAIN WHICH CONNECTS IT TO THE LIMBS. PICKLE RICK RUNS TOWARDS THE RATS AND BEGINS KILLING THEM.] Oh, yeah! Aaaah! [HE TAKES OUT A MACHINES ON HIS WRISTS WHICH ARE LOADED WITH SCREWS. HE KILLS SOME OF THE RATS. THE SCREWS DISAPPEAR AND X-ACTO BLADE POP OUT. HE KILLS MORE RATS. TRANSITION TO DR. WONG'S OFFICE.]
BETH: I didn't say my father is perfect, I said his work is important.
SUMMER: And she's saying what's important is that Grandpa lied to you to get out of coming here.
BETH: Oh, he did not!
DR. WONG: Let's do an experiment here. I get the impression this family values science. So raise your hand if you feel certain you know what was in the syringe. [NO ONE RAISES THEIR HAND.] Raise your hand if you know for certain the syringe does not contain anti-pickle serum. [BETH BEGINS TO RAISE HER HAND BUT STOPS HERSELF.] Beth, your hand did a little thing there.
BETH: Do you really not see what's happening here?
DR. WONG: Tell me.
BETH: Well, Dr. Wong -- by the way, racist name -- obviously, Morty and Summer are seizing on your arbitrary pickle obsession as an end run around what was supposed to be their therapy.
DR. WONG: Oh, I think this pickle incident is a better path than any other to the heart of your family's dysfunction. I think it's possible that you and your father have a very specific dynamic. I don't think it's one that rewards emotion or vulnerability. I think it may punish them. I think it's possible that dynamic eroded your marriage, and is infecting your kids with a tendency to misdirect their feelings.
[A SHORT PAUSE]
BETH: Fuck you.
IN UNISON
MORTY: Mom!
SUMMER: Mom!
END UNISON
BETH: Fuck both of you, too.
[TRANSITION TO PICKLE RICK, FIGHTING A MUCH LARGER GREY RAT AND BEATING IT UP.]
PICKLE RICK: By the way, you might notice that in spite of your numerous distinctive features, I never gave you a name like Scar or Stripe or Goliath. That's because, to me, you aren't special. [PICKLE RICK PINS THE RAT TO THE WALL WITH SOME SCREWS.] You were special to rats. Now they're dead. I guess it was me you should have impressed. [PICKLE RICK SLICES OPEN THE RAT'S STOMACH WITH HIS X-ACTO BLADE.] God damn it, I love myself. [PICKLE RICK WALKS UP TO A PIPE ABOVE HIM. HIS WRIST MACHINES FALL OFF AND ARE REPLACED WITH A JET PACK. HE PULLS A HOOD OVER HIS HEAD WITH A RAT'S FACE ON IT. HE TURNS ON THE JET PACK AND FLIES OUT OF THE PIPE AND OUT OF A TOILET.] Pickle Riiick! [PICKLE RICK OPENS THE DOOR. IT IS A BATHROOM DOOR WITH A "MALE" SIGN ON THE FRONT. HE STARTS RUNNING AROUND AND OPENING VARIOUS DOORS AND LOOKING IN. EVENTUALLY HE RUNS UP TO AN ELEVATOR AND TRIES TO JUMP UP TO THE BUTTONS BUT CANNOT REACH THEM. HE TRIES TO SCALE THE WALL BUT FAILS. HE PUSHES A GARBAGE CAN AND A POTTED PLANT NEXT TO EACH OTHER IN FRONT OF THE ELEVATOR BUTTONS. HE JUMPS OFF OF THE GARBAGE CAN INTO THE POTTED PLANT, THEN JUMPS INTO THE LID WHICH TURNS RAPIDLY AND PROPELS HIM UP AND SWINGS HIM TO THE ELEVATOR BUTTONS.] Get that parkour. Get that parkour! [PICKLE RICK KICKS THE "DOWN BUTTON", THEN WAITS ON THE GROUND FOR THE ELEVATOR. THE ELEVATOR OPENS, AND THREE MEN IN BLACK SUITS WITH EARPIECES STAND INSIDE. THEY NOTICE PICKLE RICK AND GASP.] Hey, it's cool. Just need to find the nearest exit. [THE MEN IN THE ELEVATOR POINT THEIR GUNS AT PICKLE RICK.] Whoa, whoa, whoa! No need to freak out. [ONE OF THE MEN YELLS SOMETHING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE INTO HIS EARPIECE AND ALL THREE MEN START SHOOTING AT HIM. HE RUNS AWAY AND THEY CHASE AFTER HIM, STILL SHOOTING AT HIM.] Whoa! Who in the fuck's toilet is this?
[TRANSITION TO THE FRONTAL EXTERIOR OF THE BUILDING. IT IS A RATHER LARGE LIGHT BROWN BUILDING WITH A STONE FENCE AND A PLETHORA OF GUARDS SURROUNDING IT. AN ALARM BLARES. SOME GUARDS RUN AROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BUILDING'S ROOF. TRANSITION TO A SURVEILLANCE ROOM WHERE THE THREE AGENTS FROM THE ELEVATOR ARE WAITING. THE AGENCY DIRECTOR SLAMS OPEN THE DOOR.]
AGENCY DIRECTOR: What is it?
AGENT #1: A pickle. A rat. Both.
AGENT #2: It says it's a scientist.
AGENCY DIRECTOR: Where is it?
AGENT #1: It seems to be using the air ducts and the mail tubes to get around. [A monitor shows Pickle Rick climbing into an air duct] It's been gathering office supplies, we think, to build weaponry. But look what it did on the mezzanine. [The monitor shows Pickle Rick jumping from a potted plant to the trash can to the recycling bin] It transferred a bottle from the trash to the recycling bin. [On the monitor, Pickle Rick picks up a glass bottle from the trash can, taunts the camera with it, throws it in the recycling bin, then runs off.] Whatever this thing is, it's shaming us.
AGENCY DIRECTOR: We have 34 armed guards, and we can't kill a pickle?
AGENT #1: 32 armed guards. He killed two.
AGENT #2: It's on the phone.
[A PHONE RINGS AND ONE OF THE MONITORS READS "INCOMING CALL".]
AGENCY DIRECTOR: Put him on, and locate the phone he's using.
AGENT #2 :PICKS UP THE PHONE] Hello.
PICKLE RICK: Hi, um, can you, uh (burps) please let me out.
AGENCY DIRECTOR: Your mere presence in this building violates international law.
AGENT #1 :[WALKS UP TO THE AGENCY DIRECTOR WITH A CLIPBOARD, WHICH READS "LEVEL 3 / ROOM 304" IN RED PEN. HE TAPS THE CLIPBOARD. THE AGENCY DIRECTOR LOOKS AT IT AND NODS.] I couldn't let you out even if you hadn't killed two men.
[TRANSITION TO PICKLE RICK. THE BOTTOM PART OF THE PHONE HE IS USING HAS BEEN DISMANTLED. HE ATTACHES A BELT AROUND HIS WAIST WHICH HAS BATTERIES IN THE BACK OF IT.
PICKLE RICK: You should know those men killed themselves.
AGENCY DIRECTOR: And how is that?
PICKLE RICK: They didn't (burps) let me out.
AGENT #2 :Solen'ya.
AGENCY DIRECTOR: Shut your mouth and do your jobs, you fucking children!
PICKLE RICK: Uh, is this not a good time or...?
[AGENT #1 HOLDS HIS EARPIECE UP TO HIS EAR. HE GIVES A THUMBS UP TO THE AGENCY DIRECTOR. ON ONE OF THE MONITORS, SIX AGENTS RUN UP TO THE DOOR OF ROOM 304 WITH RIFLES.]
AGENCY DIRECTOR: Some of my men are calling you "Solen'ya": The Pickle Man, an old wives tale. He crawls from bowls of cold soup to steal the dreams of wasteful children.
[ONE OF THE AGENTS ON THE MONITOR GIVES A THUMBS UP. THE AGENCY DIRECTOR PANTOMIMES SLICING HIS NECK TO AGENT #1.]
PICKLE RICK: That'd be a lucky break for you.
AGENT #1: Go, shoot to kill!
[TRANSITION TO ROOM 304. ONE OF THE AGENTS SLAMS OPEN THE DOOR, KNOCKING OVER A WATER JUG ABOVE THE DOOR WHICH ACTIVATES A PULLEY WHICH PULLS A STRING WHICH CUTS ANOTHER STRING WHICH SWINGS A NEEDLE TOWARDS THE AGENT'S HEAD, KILLING HIM INSTANTLY. TWO MORE AGENTS ENTER AND START TO WALK IN, BUT FALL THROUGH THE FLOOR ONTO SOME SPIKES, WHICH KILL THEM. THE THREE REMAINING AGENTS WALK IN AND SEE THIS AND BEGIN SHOOTING AT A PICKLE WHICH IS NOT PICKLE RICK, BUT A DECOY. THEY CONTINUE TO SHOOT AT THE PICKLE UNTIL IT IS COMPLETELY GONE.]
AGENT #3: Aaah! We got him.
[TRANSITION BACK TO THE SURVEILLANCE ROOM.]
AGENCY DIRECTOR: Ah.
AGENT #1: Ah.
[TRANSITION BACK TO ROOM 304. AGENT #3 TURNS A COMPUTER AROUND WITH THE TIP OF HIS GUN, WHOSE SCREEN READS "RECEIVING CALL / (INTERNET LINE)".]
PICKLE RICK: ...because this pickle doesn't care about your children. And I'm not gonna take their dreams. I'm gonna take their parents.
[PICKLE RICK STEPS ON A LAPTOP MOUSE WHOSE SCREEN READS "SENDING CALL". THE WINDOW WHICH READS THAT IS MINIMIZED AND ANOTHER WINDOW IS PULLED UP WHICH READS "SENDING EXPLOSION / ...". TRANSITION TO ROOM 304. THE COMPUTER SCREEN NOW READS "RECEIVING EXPLOSION / (INTERNET LINE)". THE LAPTOP BLOWS UP AND THE THREE AGENTS ARE SENT FLYING. PICKLE RICK JUMPS OUT OF AN AIR DUCT INTO THE HALLWAY WHERE THE THREE AGENTS ARE, HOLDING A DEVICE HE CONSTRUCTED. HE HOLDS UP THE DEVICE AND A LASER COMES OUT, WHICH BURNS A HOLE THROUGH ALL THREE OF THE MEN'S HEADS, KILLING THEM INSTANTLY. THREE MORE AGENTS COME FROM AROUND THE CORNER. PICKLE RICK RELOADS THE DEVICE AND SHOOTS ANOTHER LASER, THIS TIME CHOPPING OFF THE THREE OTHER AGENTS' ANKLES WITH IT. HE RUNS AWAY. TRANSITION TO THE SURVEILLANCE ROOM. PICKLE RICK SHOWS UP ON EACH OF THE MONITORS, AND TURNS THEM OFF AS HE APPEARS ON THEM.]
AGENT #2: Solen'ya! He's coming! It's because I threw half-way my sandwich!
AGENCY DIRECTOR: He's just a pickle!
AGENT #2: He's a monster!
AGENCY DIRECTOR: He's not the only one. [THE AGENCY DIRECTOR STRAIGHTENS HIS TIE. TRANSITION TO ANOTHER DOOR. THE AGENCY DIRECTOR USES A KEY CARD TO OPEN THE DOOR, WHICH LEADS TO ANOTHER METAL DOOR WITH TWO GUARDS STANDING NEXT TO IT. HE TURNS THE WHEEL ON THE DOOR, OPENING IT. JAGUAR SITS INSIDE.] You can stay, dead to the world and die in this room. Or you can kill a pickle for me and earn your freedom.
JAGUAR: There is no freedom while your leader breathes. Our country is a prison.
AGENCY DIRECTOR: Then Katarina is a prisoner. Perhaps I could arrange her escape, as well. She lives, Jaguar.
JAGUAR: Where is this pickle?
[TRANSITION TO DR. WONG'S OFFICE.]
DR. WONG: What do you think is in the syringe, Beth?
BETH: You're the one that costs $200 an hour. You tell me.
SUMMER: Anti-pickle serum.
MORTY: Anti-pickle serum.
DR. WONG: Your kids think it might be anti-pickle serum.
BETH: My kids pee their desks and suck on unbaked vases. [MORTY PICKS UP A BOOK WHICH SITS ON DR. WONG'S COFFEE TABLE, WHICH HE OPENS AND READS] They're just angry at me for divorcing their father.
SUMMER: I never said I was angry at you.
BETH: That's the point of pottery-enamel huffing, Summer. You do it so you don't have to say "I'm angry at mommy" out loud.
MORTY: Oh, my God! [MORTY CLOSES THE BOOK AND PUTS IT BACK ON THE COFFEE TABLE, POINTING AT IT] Oh, there-there's pictures of people eating poop in there! [DR. WONG PICKS THE BOOK UP AND PUTS IT ON HER LAP]
DR. WONG: It's not my job to take sides or pass judgment. Do you think when your father asks for that syringe, you could ask him --
BETH: He won't have to ask for it, okay? He won't need it. He'll just make more. He doesn't need anything from anyone.
DR. WONG: You admire him for that.
BETH: It's better than making your problems other people's problems.
[TRANSITION TO PICKLE RICK AND JAGUAR FIGHTING IN AN OFFICE. PICKLE RICK TRIES TO SHOOT JAGUAR WITH HIS LASER WHILE JAGUAR TRIES TO SHOOT AT PICKLE RICK WITH TWO GUNS. A BULLET HITS PICKLE RICK AND TAKES A SMALL CHUNK OUT OF HIM.]
PICKLE RICK: Oh, come on!
[PICKLE RICK HITS JAGUAR'S SHOULDER WITH THE LASER, PICKLE RICK HIDES BEHIND A SHELF WHILE JAGUAR HIDES BEHIND A DESK]
JAGUAR: Pickle Man, you should know this isn't personal!
[JAGUAR BITES A BULLET, AND POURS THE GUNPOWDER INTO A COFFEE FILTER]
PICKLE RICK: You should know that isn't original.
[PICKLE RICK KICKS OPEN A STYROFOAM CONTAINER WITH A BURGER INSIDE AND PULLS IT TOWARDS HIM]
JAGUAR: They have my daughter. [JAGUAR TAKES A WATER BOTTLE AND POURS THE WATER INTO HIS OPEN WOUND] There's nothing I won't do to see her again.
PICKLE RICK: Yeah, there's lots I wouldn't do to see my daughter, but killing you gets me to her quicker than your derivative bullshit.
[PICKLE RICK TAKES A TOMATO SLICE OUT OF THE BURGER AND SQUEEZES IT ONTO HIS MISSING CHUNK. HE PULLS OUT A PACKET OF MUSTARD AND BITES IT OPEN. JAGUAR POURS THE GUNPOWDER INTO HIS WOUND AND WINCES. PICKLE RICK RUBS MUSTARD ON HIS MISSING CHUNK AND SHOUTS, SQUEEZING OPEN THE MUSTARD PACKET. JAGUAR LIGHTS A MATCH AND PUTS IT UP TO THE WOUND, SETTING IT ON FIRE. PICKLE RICK GRABS A STAPLER AND STAPLES A PICKLE SLICE TO HIS MISSING CHUNK. BOTH SHOUT IN UNISON]
JAGUAR: I never bullshit, Pickle Man. This can only end with one of us dead, and I have never died.
PICKLE RICK: That will be your downfall, Jaguar, not being open to new experiences.
[TRANSITION TO SURVEILLANCE ROOM. THE TWO CONTINUE FIGHTING. PICKLE RICK'S LASER GRADUALLY TAKES OUT ALL OF THE CAMERAS
AGENCY DIRECTOR :Is it done? Jaguar?!
PICKLE RICK: Jaguar couldn't make it.
AGENCY DIRECTOR: Do it. Okay, you win, Pickle Man. I'm unsealing the building.
PICKLE RICK: No, thanks. I'm coming for you now.
AGENCY DIRECTOR: Pickle Man, there's $100 million worth of bonds in a safe on level two. I'll give you the combination.
AGENT #2: That money belongs to the people.
AGENCY DIRECTOR: Shut up and call me a helicopter, you prick! Do we have a deal?!
PICKLE RICK: Take that money, give it to Jaguar's daughter when you set her free. Or I'll be visiting you.
AGENCY DIRECTOR: Jaguar's daughter is dead.
PICKLE RICK: Huh, so you're a liar.
AGENCY DIRECTOR: Jaguar was an animal. You're an intelligent pickle. We can do business.
PICKLE RICK: I don't think so. See you soon.
AGENCY DIRECTOR: Is the helicopter here?
AGENT #2: Yes. And the police are on the way. What do we tell them? Ooh! Aah!
AGENCY DIRECTOR: Tell them we were robbed.
AGENT #2: Hey! Hey, what are you doing?! I'm right here!
AGENCY DIRECTOR: Farewell, Solen'ya.
[F-15S ARE SCRAMBLED.]
JAGUAR: This helicopter will be shot down in seven minutes.
PICKLE RICK: Well, my daughter is about five away, and I've got about eight to live.
JAGUAR: Pickle Man, it's too late for me to tell my daughter I love her, but not for you.
PICKLE RICK: Oh, well, uh, she knows. I mean, we don't really buy into that kind of crap, to the extent that love is an expression of familiarity over time, my access to infinite timelines precludes the necessity of attachment. In fact, I even abandoned one of my infinite daughters in an alternate version of earth that was taken over by mutants.
JAGUAR: Okay. Good luck with that. Wait. Do I have infinite daughters?
PICKLE RICK: Huh? Uh, no. No, nope, sorry about that. Nope, just me. Yeesh!
[TRANSITION TO DR. WONG'S OFFICE.]
BETH: I am afraid that my kids will get expelled.
DR. WONG: Good. Summer, you go.
SUMMER: I am mad that I can't huff enamel without people assuming it's because my family sucks. I hope to be seen one day as someone that just likes getting high.
DR. WONG: Good job. Morty, do you have an "I" statement? I am sad that I peed.
MORTY: I'm sad that I peed in class instead of a toilet.
DR. WONG: Look at this family go. You guys are pros. What do you guys think about doing this once a week?
PICKLE RICK: Ugh.
[PICKLE RICK WALKS IN AND FLOPS ON THE COUCH NEXT TO SUMMER.]
DR. WONG: You must be Rick.
PICKLE RICK: Mm-hmm.
DR. WONG: I've heard a lot about you today. Your family is crazy about you. Your daughter holds you in very high regard. You're a lucky fella.
PICKLE RICK: Yeah, thank you. Uh, sweetie, you don't still happen to have that syringe in your purse?
BETH: Dad I would like you to tell me what's in the syringe. It's a serum that I need to, uh, to stay alive. I have had a rough day. And, uh, I've sustained a lot of damage. I'm pretty close to death, which the serum will prevent.
DR. WONG: By changing you from a pickle to a human.
PICKLE RICK: Yes.
DR. WONG: Rick, why did you lie to your daughter? So I wouldn't have to come here.
PICKLE RICK: Why didn't you want to come here? Because I don't respect therapy, because I'm a scientist. Because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything. I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow. I'm a pickle When I feel like it. So you asked.
DR. WONG: Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness. You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse. And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here, you chose to talk to belittle my vocation, just as you chose to become a pickle. You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand. I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some people well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose. That's our time. I'm going to give you guys my card and hope to hear from you again. And if you have any friends or family that eat poop and would like to stop, give them my number.
[TRANSITION TO BETH'S CAR.]
PICKLE RICK: I, um I'm sorry I lied to get out of the thing. I, I shouldn't lie to you.
BETH: Oh, it's fine. I mean, thank you, and, yeah, you shouldn't. But I hope you know that's not what that session was supposed to be.
PICKLE RICK: Oh, no, I mean, I know it was Morty peeing his pants and Summer snorting glue or whatever She huffed enamel, and we never even talked about it. Well, there was so much more at stake.
PICKLE RICK: I mean, that shrink, what a monologuist.
MORTY: Are we gonna go back?
PICKLE RICK: Sweetie, could I get Get that syringe now?
BETH: Oh, my God, yes! Dad, it's in my purse. Oh, I'm sorry. You must be in agony.
RICK: Eh. Jesus. Jesus Christ. Therapists, man.
BETH: Weird breed.
RICK: Man, I missed having hands and blood and a stomach. [To Beth] We should get a drink.
BETH :Really? Like, go somewhere?
RICK: Yeah, let's drop the kids off and go tie one on.
BETH: Absolutely.
MORTY: I, I liked her.
RICK: So what are you thinking, like, Smokey's Tavern? Maybe Shoney's?
BETH Yeah, either one.
RICK :Either one.
[POST CREDITS. TRANSITION TO CONCERTO'S DEATH TRAP PIANO.]
RICK: You'll never get away with this, Concerto.
CONCERTO: That is where you're mistaken, Mr. Sanchez. This shall be my greatest performance of all time!
RICK: This is it, Morty. We're goners. We're not getting out of this one. After everything we've been through, this is how we're gonna die. Make peace with your god.
MORTY: Oh, geez, Rick, I-I-I don't want to die!
CONCERTO: And now for the E-splat!
[JAGUAR GLIDES IN AND KILLS CONCERTO.]
RICK: Jaguar!
MORTY: Who? Who was that, Rick?
RICK: That, Morty, is why you don't go to therapy.
EPISODE
RICK: Jerry! Jerry, come on! We got to go! You got to come with me, Jerry!
JERRY: Rick?
RICK: It’s important, Jerry. The fate of the galaxy rests on your shoulders. Let’s go. Put some pants on. N-Never mind, there’s no time for pants, Jerry. I’ll make you a pair of pants on the way. It’s a Rick and Jerry adventure! Rick and Jerry episode!
[OPENING]
RICK: Then I thought, "Hey, what about Jerry? He’s… He’s good with regular folk." This is a real situation where… where… Where Jerry could really shine. "He’s a master convincer."
JERRY: Rick, I’m not an idiot. I know what this is.
RICK: Oh. Okay, well, I told Morty, "Look, parents get divorced. They get sad. He’ll be fine," but I think he’s worried you’re gonna, you know Pbht! And you know how Morty gets when he gets emotional. It impedes my work. So, I told him I’d take you out and give you a win.
JERRY: Wait. My son asked you to take me on some kind of pity adventure to keep me from killing myself?
RICK: Wait, w-what did you think it was?
JERRY: An execution.
RICK: Geez! You really do need a win.
JERRY: No! I-I don’t know. I mean, you never made me the pants, so…
RICK: So, you thought I was gonna drive you into the middle of the galaxy and shove you into the vacuum of space with your dick hanging out? And we’re seeing how you’d act if that were about to happen? I mean [bleep] I’ll make you the pants right now. Take me two seconds to make you pants.
JERRY: I have pants at home!
RICK: Jerry, if I make pants, they’ll be better than your pants at home. Also, if I wanted to kill you…
JERRY: Yeah, I get it. It would be amazing. Please, take me home. I’ll tell my son we had an amazing adventure.
RICK: Well, if it’s all the same, could we go get our story straight? Because you’re a terrible liar.
JERRY: You called me a master convincer!
RICK: You believed me?
JERRY: Huh. This seems kind of fancy.
RICK: Jerry, for all you know, this is the equivalent of an alien truck stop. You have no frame of reference. You’re in a universe beyond your imagining. But, yes, it is super fancy. I mean, my job here is to make Morty happy. I’m not gonna take you somewhere dangerous.
SHNOOPY BLOOPERS: Rick Sanchez. I told you if I ever saw your face in here again, I would stick you like the pig you are.
RICK: Shnoopy Bloopers, I told you if you tried There’d be two funerals.
JERRY: Aaah!! Someone? Uh, someone? Someone!
SHNOOPY BLOOPERS: My friend! It has been too long.
RICK: Oh, it’s great to see you again, buddy! Yeah, you’re doing it.
SHNOOPY BLOOPERS: Mr. Sanchez gets anything he wants!
RICK: The resort’s covered in an immortality field. You can’t die here. That’s the gimmick.
[TWO CHILDREN ARE SEEN KILLING EACH OTHER]
JERRY: Okay, but still Bad parenting.
RICK: Hey, rich a-holes are rich a-holes. They all pay top dollar to come here and enjoy a consequence-free vacation. No death, no disease, no dismemberment. Can’t even have a heart attack.
JERRY: Got it. The perfect place to take the most fragile being in the universe.
RICK: I can tell you expect me to refute that, but it’s right on the money. If I come home without you, I doubt Morty’s gonna let me off the hook.
JERRY: Yeah, but what if you came home with Jeff Goldblum.
JERRY: Jeff Goldblum? What the are you talking about, Jerry? Jesus! Holy shit! Yo, what’s up, "Big Chill"?! Don’t go into the telepod!
JERRY: Hey, maybe we would have fun on a fake adventure.
RICK: On a fake adventure.
JERRY: Speaking of What are we gonna tell Morty?
RICK: I don’t know. But whatever it is, we’re gonna need a couple more of these babies!
[SMITH FAMILY LIVING ROOM]
BETH: What’s wrong?
SUMMER: Mom, do you think I’m hot?
BETH: I don’t think that’s something that matters.
SUMMER: So, I’m not hot?!
BETH: I’m saying the part of you that cares about that is a part you shouldn’t give any energy to.
SUMMER: That’s not an answer!
BETH: Because I’m not an issue of Cosmo, okay? I’m your mother and a doctor, and
SUMMER: I’m hideous!
MORTY: Geez. What’s with her?
BETH: Teenage-girl stuff.
MORTY: Is that a hoof collage?
BETH: It’s perfectly legal, if that’s what you’re wondering.
MORTY: Cool zies.
[GARAGE]
SUMMER: "We just don’t have anything in common any more, Summer." Oh, yeah, Ethan? What do you have in common with Tricia Lange? A mutual love of French cinema? The belief that a carbon tax is the only viable solution to climate change? Or could it be her massive stripper titties?! There it is.Boob-ya!
[RESORT WHERE YOU CAN'T DIE]
JERRY: And that’s when Malakai the Squid came, rips off his face, and beneath it is my face.
THREE-HEADED FELLOW AT THE BAR: I liked it.
JERRY: Thank you, sir.
RICK: Yeah, of course he likes it. Look at him. Mother got two heads and three trunks.
JERRY: All right, we’ll put a pin in it. I’m gonna go take a leak. [Restroom] What the?! My hands are dry! My hands are dry!
RISOTTO GROUPON: My name is Risotto Groupon. I am the assistant general manager of the restaurant.
JERRY: Do you have any comment cards, because I might have some thoughts.
RISOTTO GROUPON: My kingdom was usurped by force with weapons and technology supplied by your father-in-law!
JERRY: Hey, he usurped my kingdom, too, man. He basically got me kicked out of my home, stole my family.
RISOTTO GROUPON: Then we are brothers, and you have wondered what your life could have been without Rick.
JERRY: Wondered? Sure. I mean, I’ve wondered about having a vagina.
RISOTTO GROUPON: Would you help me kill him?
JERRY: What? No! He’s my wife’s father. Move on.
RISOTTO GROUPON: Do you like theme-park rides?
JERRY: Oh, you really moved on.
RISOTTO GROUPON: There is a popular attraction here called the Whirly Dirly. Between the first whirly and the third dirly, the ride dips just outside the immortality field.
JERRY: You’re asking me to lure Rick to his death?
RISOTTO GROUPON: I’m only asking you to go on a ride with Rick, get off the ride without Rick, and go home to your family, where you can wonder about having a vagina.
JERRY: Okay, okay, that was a very specific example pulled from thin air. I don’t want to be known as the vagina guy.
RESTAURANT EMPLOYEE: Risotto, you’re needed. Someone ordered the Nuzzy Guzzy Fresh and Fluzzy Special.
RISOTTO GROUPON: [sighs]Look, I’m not like Rick, so you’re free to do as you please. But there comes a time in every man’s life when he must choose the foundation on which his legacy will be built One of compromise or one of blood.
[HE LEAVES AND JERRY IS LEFT PONDERING HIS PROPOSAL] [SMITH FAMILY GARAGE]

BETH: WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?! HOW DO WE GET HER BACK TO NORMAL?!
MORTY: I DON’T KNOW, MAN! THIS THING IS PRETTY COMPLICATED. I-I’M GONNA CALL RICK.
BETH: WELL, HOLD ON. WE CAN’T JUST CALL YOUR GRANDPA WHENEVER THERE’S A PROBLEM. WE CAN HANDLE THIS OURSELVES.
MORTY: I MEAN, I DON’T SEE THE POINT IN TRYING TO. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY RICK-LEVEL SHIT
BETH: I HAVE A MEDICAL DEGREE.
MORTY: IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT? L-LIKE, YOU WANT TO PROVE YOURSELF?

JERRY: OH, I GUESS YOU’RE RIGHT.

JERRY: TO THE WHIRLY DIRLY.
RICK: THE WHIRLY DIRLY? ALL RIGHT, WHAT’S GOING ON HERE? WHEN DID YOU GET COOL?!

JERRY: WHIRLY DIRLY, BABY.
[SMITH FAMILY HOUSE]
BETH: AHA, LOOK AT THIS. IT SAYS "NORMALIZE." I BET IF WE JUST PRESS THAT
MORTY: BUT IF THE MACHINE WAS MADE BY SPIDER PEOPLE, NORMAL WOULD MEAN EIGHT LEGS.
BETH: OH, GOD! ARE YOU GONNA GO ON ANOTHER SPIEL LIKE YOU DID WITH THE FLESH-COLORED CRAYON? I’M PRETTY SURE "NORMALIZE" WILL MAKE HER NORMAL. AAH! I’D CALL THAT PROGRESS.

JERRY: RICK! RICK! I KNEW YOU WOULDN’T LET ME DIE.
RICK: THAT WAS NEVER AN OPTION.

RICK: THAT’S NOT NICE.
JERRY: WHAT’S THAT? DID YOU JUST HAVE A CONTROVERSIAL THOUGHT?
RICK: NO.
JERRY: THAT’S WHAT I THOUGHT, BITCH. YOU LITTLE PUNK-ASS. THIS IS THE BEST.
ASSASSIN: I AGREE. YOU’VE MADE THINGS EVEN EASIER THAN IF YOU HADN’T BEEN INCOMPETENT.
RICK: UH-OH. WE GET SHOOT-SHOOT NOW.
CAPTAIN'S VOICE: ALRIGHT FOLKS, IF YOU COULD PLEASE TAKE YOUR SEATS, WE’RE ABOUT TO ENTER THE WORMHOLE. SO, I HOPE EVERYBODY BOUGHT A DINNER FIRST.
RICK: NICE.
JERRY: NICE.
ASSASSIN: JERRY, STEP OVER THERE AND LOCK YOURSELF IN THE ESCAPE POD.
JERRY: YOU’RE NOT KILLING US?
ASSASSIN: I’M KILLING RICK. YOU’RE FREE TO GO. YOU’RE NO THREAT TO ME OR ANYONE.
JERRY: NOW YOU’RE JUST BEING MEAN.
RICK: YEAH, YOU’RE MEAN NO OFFENSE.
ASSASSIN: MEAN WOULD BE SHOOTING YOU, JERRY. THIS IS SAVING A BULLET. GO BACK TO YOUR QUIETLY ASHAMED FAMILY AND LIVE OUT THE REST OF YOUR DAYS IN DENIAL OF YOUR VAGINA FANTASIES.
JERRY: IT WAS A ONE-TIME THOUGHT THAT EVERYONE HAS!
ASSASSIN: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
JERRY: I’M BEING TRIUMPHANTLY BRAVE!
ASSASSIN: IT’S NOT TRIUMPHANT OR BRAVE. YOU’RE NOT RISKING ANYTHING.
JERRY: YOU MIGHT SHOOT ME.
ASSASSIN: I THINK YOU KNOW I WON’T. BECAUSE YOU KNOW I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU. YOU’RE JUST DOING THIS SO YOU CAN TELL YOURSELF YOU FOUGHT OW!
COMPUTER VOICE: TEMPORAL SHIELD COMPROMISED.
ASSASSIN: CONGRATULATIONS, JERRY. YOU GET TO DIE A MAN.
JERRY: UH, THAT’S OKAY! I’LL LEAVE! PLEASE DON’T SHOOT. I-I’M THE VAGINA GUY, REMEMBER? WHOA! WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ME? WHERE IS THIS? WHERE AM I? AM I DEAD? A-AM I AM I STILL ALIVE?
RICK: THOSE AREN’T THE QUESTIONS YOU SHOULD BE ASKING.
JERRY: HUH?!
RICK: SHH! AH, GOT YA! COME HERE, YOU LITTLE PUMPKIN. I HAVE SHIT ON MY ASS.
ASSASSIN: WHOA, OOF THIS!
RICK: WHO AM I?
ASSASSIN: WHO AM I?
JERRY: I’M TIME! I’M LITERALLY TIME!
ALL: WHOOOOA! AAH!
JERRY: OH, GOD. I FEEL LIKE OUR SOULS WERE UNITED, AND WE WERE ALL ONE WITH ETERNITY.
ASSASSIN: OUR BODY’S UNCHANGED, YET OUR MINDS HAVE LIVED A THOUSAND LIFETIMES. IS THAT ENOUGH TIME FOR ME TO FORGIVE YOU?
RICK: I DON’T KNOW, BUT IT’S ENOUGH TIME FOR A SYNAPTIC DAMPENER TO WEAR OFF.
JERRY: [BLEEP]! HE HADN’T DECIDED HE WAS STILL GOING TO KILL US!
RICK: HE WAS TALKING HIMSELF INTO IT. I’VE SEEN IT BEFORE. COSMIC APOTHEOSIS WEARS OFF FASTER THAN SALVIA.
JERRY: I’M STARTING TO BELIEVE YOU BECAUSE I JUST FINISHED MERGING WITH YOUR ESSENCE FOR AN ENDLESS EPOCH, AND I’M ALREADY BACK TO THINKING YOU’RE AN ASSHOLE.
RICK: FINE WITH ME. LET’S JUST GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS. SOUNDS LIKE YOU AND THE WORD "EPOCH" HAVE A LOT OF CATCHING UP TO DO.
JERRY: WAIT, DON’T LEAVE ME!
CAPTAIN'S VOICE: ALRIGHT FOLKS, YOU'RE FREE TO GET UP AND WALK AROUND THE CABIN AND MAYBE TAKE THE WORMHOLE OUT FOR BREAKFAST.
ANOTHER VOICE: OK, YOU CAN DO THE DINNER ONE OR THE BREAKFAST ONE BUT NOT BOTH.

RICK: I’LL MAKE YOU A DEAL. I’LL LEAVE OUT THE PART WHERE YOU TRIED TO MURDER ME
JERRY: AND I’LL LEAVE OUT THE PART WHERE YOU ADMITTED TO SABOTAGING OUR MARRIAGE.
RICK: YOU WANT TO?
JERRY: NAH, IF THE FAMILY SEES ME LIKE THIS, THEY’LL FEEL SORRY FOR ME. WHICH IS NO LONGER MY SIGNATURE MOVE. LATER DAYS, AMIGO. ACTUALLY, I JUST REALIZED, I DON’T HAVE MY WALLET, AND MY BUS PASS IS IN THERE, SO MAYBE

RICK: Morty, hurry!
MORTY: Return the Truth Tortoise!
RICK: Morty, whatever you do, don’t drop the Truth Tortoise! Also really important, whatever you do, don’t look into its eyes!
MORTY: I I did look at it, Rick! I’ve been looking at it!
RICK: Now you’re gonna know everything, Morty! Good job! Way to go! You [BLEEP] everything up!
MORTY: It’s in my head! Ah! Oh, geez, I I can’t get that Truth Tortoise out of my head.
RICK: Yeah, I told you not to look into its eyes. [Smith family living room]Hey, Morty, let’s watch some interdimensional cable. Remember how we used to do that?
MORTY: Rick, I can’t I can’t go on. I-I can’t go on like this with the Truth Tortoise shit in my head. I-I wish you could just
RICK: Erase the memory from your mind?
MORTY: How did you know I was gonna say that?
RICK: Come on, Morty, come with me.
RICK: After you.
MORTY: What the hell is this?!
RICK: This, Morty, is my archive of all the experiences you’ve begged me to remove from your life, lest you go insane. I call them Morty’s Mind Blowers. And we’ll be doing this instead of interdimensional cable.
[OPENING CREDITS]
MORTY: How long have I been asking you to remove memories?
RICK: Since the first time your mind was blown. Ahh, here it is. Classic. There’s no dust on it because this isn’t the first time we’ve done this.
MORTY: - What?! -
RICK: I call this one "Moonspiracy"!
MORTY: Huh, wow. That’s incredible. What the heck?
BETH: Morty, do you realize how ridiculous that sounds?
RICK: Yeah, pretty crazy story, Morty.
MORTY: Are you serious? Half the crap we’ve seen, and you think that sounds crazy?
RICK: I’ve been to 300 versions of Earth’s moon, including this one, and I’ve never seen signs of a "regular dude," as you describe him, hanging out up there.
SUMMER: It’s probably just a smudge on the lens.
MORTY: Smudge on the lens? Smudge on the lens?! I know the difference between a man threatening me and a smudge on the goddamn lens, Summer!
BETH: Morty, calm down! Are you feeling okay?
MORTY: I’m fine!
SUMMER: So sensitive.
[SCHOOL]
PRINCIPAL: Kids, I’d like to introduce you all to our new guidance counselor, Mr. Lunas.
MR. LUNAS: I look forward to helping guide you all towards a brighter future. I believe every student should shoot for the moon.
MORTY: Got you now, you son of a bitch.
PRINCIPAL: What’s this?
MORTY: Proof that Mr. Lunas isn’t who he says he is! He’s not a guidance counselor? I I assume he’s qualified to be one, who isn’t? But he also lives on the moon.
PRINCIPAL: Okay. Hmm. Is that it? Is he doing anything to hurt anyone?
MORTY: Oh, he’s up to something.
PRINCIPAL: I think I understand. "Up to something," "lives on the moon. " Okay, I’ll talk to him.
MORTY: What did he say?
PRINCIPAL: Denied the moon stuff, but that’s what pedophiles do, they deny, it’s their bread and butter.
MORTY: Pedophile?
PRINCIPAL: You don’t think so? I thought the moon thing might have been code.
MORTY: No, he’s literally from the moon!
PRINCIPAL: Well, you saw him react. Moon or not, that dude likes ‘em young.
[GRAVESITE]
MARINE: Gordon Lunas was a good Marine. We don’t know what drove him to take his own life, but we want to remember the good things. Like how, from a certain angle, some people would say he looked like a smudge.
[TELESCOPE]
MORTY: Oh, my God, what have I done? What have I done? Jesus, I made that guy kill himself!
RICK: Only in a literal sense. Here’s one I call "Morty’s Menagerie. " They don’t all have titles, though. It’s not a "Simpsons" Halloween special, more like a clip show made of clips you never saw! I can’t believe we got put into a menagerie.
MORTY: So this guy collects living beings?
RICK: Yeah, you know like commemorative plates, but less off-putting. You’ll get it when you’re still actively dating in your 40s. Assess this with cold indifference, you beany-headed prick! Hey, keep it down! Just our luck, menagerie beneath the "boulder people" of Granitor Seven.
MORTY: I can’t take it anymore, Rick!
RICK: Relax, Morty!
MORTY: I can’t relax! R-R-Rick, we We gotta get outta here! I don’t care what it takes! Anything! -
RICK: Anything? -
MORTY: Anything!
RICK: All right, well, you’re gonna have to take off your shirt. Not yet. I’ll tell you when.
[SETI]
LADY SCIENTIST: Dear God.
DUDE SCIENTIST: What?
LADY SCIENTIST: The signal turned out to be There’s no other way to put it Instructions.
OFFICIAL: For?
LADY SCIENTIST: A vehicle, sir, an interstellar vehicle.
OFFICIAL: We’ll need a pilot. I wonder if there’s a volunteer. Mm.
LADY SCIENTIST: Oh, the schematics specify a second, smaller pilot. I mean, they really specify smaller. They have to be exactly 5’3".
OFFICIAL: Chang, you may have majored in Liberal Arts, but I think you’re about to make history.
LADY SCIENTIST: Primary systems, check. Auxiliary systems, check. See you soon.
RICK: Okay, now.
A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW Greetings. You’re You look We’ve possessed forms your mind can accept. Here are some customary clothing gifts. Please, put them on. - May we? - Of course, yes. We followed your instructions. We have so much to learn from you. I know, right?
MORTY: Hey, how come I was able to see those other people’s memories? I I wouldn’t have been around for that.
RICK: Yeah, sometimes I gotta do a little editing, Morty. It helps the mind blowers play a little bit better upon revisiting. I call this one "The Whole Enchilada. " Here, Morty, this’ll make your urine drinkable.
MORTY: Now can we keep shopping?
ZIKZAK: I am Zikzak.
RICK: Ah, shit, Morty, get behind me. It’s a [BLEEP] alien overlord! It’s okay. Here. Oh, I misjudged.
MORTY: [reads]"I am Floop Floopian. Please kill me."
RICK: That’s right, Morty. The Floop Floopians achieve an eternal orgasmic afterlife, so long as they’re killed by a great warrior. I’m flattered, by the way. Thank you very much.
MORTY: So you’re gonna kill him?
RICK: Eh, let’s get some lunch first. So, you want to get shot in the head, or
ZIKZAK: Well, as long as the wound is fatal, I don’t really mind where you shoot me.
RICK: Cool. I’m gonna go take a quick shit.
MORTY: Well, I gotta say. You know, I’m a little envious. Your species has an actual afterlife. That’s gotta be nice.
ZIKZAK: Wh-What do you mean?
MORTY: Well, you know, here on Earth, w-we don’t know what’s going on. It must be nice for you guys to, you know, have that Have that proof’s in the pudding, you know, evidence.
ZIKZAK: Evidence? There’s supposed to be evidence?
RICK: Um, yeah, uh otherwise, how do you know if it’s true? Wait, you don’t
RICK: All right, so you want to do this here or outside?
MORTY: Run!
ZIKZAK: I don’t wanna die! Oh, God, it’s all real! Oh, it hurts! Oh, I shouldn’t have doubted it! I shouldn’t have let you make me doubt it! Aah! I blame you, I blame you!
MORTY: But he said there wasn’t any evidence!
RICK: That was a ton of evidence! Well, silver lining. Now I know their religion’s real. They have a hell, and it does not look good. I noticed you never finished your chimichanga, so I got some room for it now, if you know what I mean.
MORTY: Holy [BLEEP]! How many of these are just horrible mistakes I’ve made? I mean, maybe I’d stop making so many if I let myself learn from them!
RICK: Don’t break your back creating a lesson, Morty. It’s a freeform anthology. I’m getting annoyed you’re not hearing that. As you can see around me, your mind’s been blown countless times, and not always by yourself.
MORTY: Ah, [BLEEP], I don’t even
RICK: This better not have been a good one. What is this? Great, "Booger AIDS," "AIDS Booger." I gotta start using real file names.In the meantime, enjoy a grab bag of mind blowers I call "Poop AIDS underscore copy."
ALIEN KING: I’m not an unreasonable man, Beth Smith. I know children are everything to a mammal. I will spare one of their lives. You simply have to choose.
BETH: Summer! Summer.
RICK: You’re not gonna believe this. I went to Phoebe instead of Titan. It’s, like, hello, Saturn, after ten moons, time to stop naming and start numbering, you know? What’s Wh-What’s with you assholes?
BETH: Morty, please, don’t do this.
MORTY: Your Morty is gone! I am Voltamatron, Destroyer of Worlds!
SUMMER: Grandpa Rick, there must be some scientific way to save him!
RICK: Not scientific, but there may be a way. Morty, I know you’re in there. It’s me, your grandpa. I know I can be mean, but I love you, Morty. We all do, you gotta fight this thing. I know you can. You’re stronger than all of us!
BETH: Morty, it’s mom! We love you, you have to fight it!
SUMMER: Come on, Morty! Fight that stupid worm thing! We love you! We love you so much! Yes, Morty, come on, you’re doing it! You’re doing it! You’re doing it! Should we pull it out?
RICK: No, don’t touch it. Just keep loving Morty!
BETH: We still love you. But I do have a thing at 6:00.
SUMMER: Oh, God, do I have to keep looking?
RICK: Geez, Morty, come on, pinch it off already! Don’t! Oh, God, sorry, Morty, I love you! God, is there going to be an intermission? Excuse me, but I ordered the large evil space worm.I know, it’s like, is that a demon slug in your stomach, or are you just happy to Sorry!
MORTY: Well, I guess it’s nice to know the whole family sucks! So if the blues ones are my fault, and the purple ones are my family’s, what are the red ones?
RICK: Yeah, d-don’t read into it, Morty!
MORTY: Ahh.
RICK: [BLEEP] We need to find shelter before the sunset, Morty. Venzenulon Nine has a night temperature of 300 below! We’ll freeze, Morty! W-We’ll be dead in seconds!
MORTY: I I think I saw a cave over there.
RICK: You’ve seen too many movies, Morty. A cave isn’t gonna cut it. We’re gonna have to use Beebo.
MORTY: Beebo led us to water! He’s our friend! -
RICK: He won’t even feel it! -
MORTY: Oh, no, no!
RICK: You wanna die, Morty? Get in Beebo! Oh, no, no! Brace for the ice limit. Here it comes! Wait, are we on Venzenulon Nine or Venzenulon Seven?
MORTY: Wait a minute, why would I ask for that to be removed? Are the red ones stuff you wanted removed?
RICK: Ooh, that’s clever, Morty, but I don’t use color to sort things because I’m not a mouse in a European children’s book.
MORTY: Then why are all those pink ones by the liquor?
RICK: Liquor? [Bleep], that was close.
MORTY: We lost Captain Sky. He gave his life for the uprising.
RICK: Yeah. It really makes you think, huh, Morty? We should never take things for granite.
MORTY: - What? -
RICK: I’m just saying, life’s short. We shouldn’t take things for granite.
MORTY: - Are you saying "granite"? -
RICK: Well, yeah.
MORTY: It’s "granted," with a "D." Take things for granted. Did you actually think it was Jesus Christ, Rick, what are you, a boulder A rock person? How long have you been saying that wrong?
RICK: Oh, you like that, huh? I b-b-bet that really blows your mind.
MORTY: I mean, yeah, it’s kind of great.
RICK: - You want me to erase it? -
MORTY: What, you can do that?
RICK: Ah, [BLEEP].
MORTY: I [BLEEP] knew it, you piece of [BLEEP]! You You You’re a [BLEEP] asshole, Rick!
RICK: Take it easy, Morty, come on. Just relax.
MORTY: No, I’m not gonna [BLEEP] relax! Come here!
RICK: Let go of me, you little bitch!
MORTY: I’m gonna grab you by the scruff of your
RICK: Take that!
MORTY: Ohh! -
RICK Umm.
MORTY: - Umm. Uhh.- What -
RICK: What’s going on? -
MORTY: Where am I? -
RICK: Who are we?
MORTY: Who am I? I think I’m an adolescent boy.
RICK: Huh, and I’m an elderly man. And we appear to be in some kind of secret confined space.Yeah, umm Don’t look at me like that. For all we know, you could be the [BLEEP] weirdo. Huh, these things are obviously storage units, and since we can’t remember what went wrong, my guess is that the technology involves memory, and that this thing on your head is designed to Tell us the code, jagoff! It’s pointless. He’s stonewalling.
MORTY: Rick, if we don’t unlock those vaccines, Earth dies! You know, it might be time to step up your interrogation!
RICK: Not sure what you’re implying, Morty, but some lines I don’t cross.
MORTY: Yeah, well, I crossed every line I had when this bastard tried to kill Jessica!
RICK: Okay, see those two fleshy sacs under his chin, Morty? Grab ‘em. You remember the codes now? Twist! Give us the codes, man! Twist harder, Morty! Harder! Okay, let go, let go, let him breathe. He wants to make a deal. Half the codes now, half after you finish.
MORTY: But can we trust Wait, what? F-Finish what?
RICK: Y-You know
MORTY: I thought I was torturing him!
RICK: Oh, and this disappoints you? Do I tell him we don’t have a deal, Morty? Because if we can kill our enemies, but we can’t jack them off, then how are we better than them?
MORTY: Well, what did you find out? We’re partners, I guess, and we fight aliens, like "Men in Black"?
RICK: "Men in Black," "Men in Black." I have "Men in Black 2" in here.
MORTY: So So you get the general idea.
RICK: Not quite. It’s basically an endless string of callbacks to
MORTY: All right, save it for Youtube.I’ll keep looking for clues.
RICK: What are you doing?
MORTY: You want your shelf level or not?
RICK: And if I say yes, you’re gonna provide that for me with that?
MORTY: Yes, see the bubble?
RICK: I’m familiar with the bubble, Morty. I also dabble in precision, and if you think you can even approach it with your sad, naked, caveman eyeball and a bubble of [BLEEP] air, you’re the reason this species is a failure, and it makes me angry!
MORTY: You’re drunk.
RICK: You want to put up a shelf, put up a shelf You want to experience true level? Do you?
MORTY: Y-yes.
RICK: Ugh, all right, come on.
MORTY: Wow, it’s so Oh, oh, oh, oh, my God, oh, Christ, ooh, ooh, ooh, ahh.
RICK: Oh, yeah, true level, bitch.
SUMMER: Morty, come on, we’re leaving for school.
MORTY: Oh, everything’s crooked! Reality is poison! I want to go back! I hate this!
SUMMER: What’s his deal?
MORTY: Can’t live like this! Shh, shh, shh, shh, Morty, Morty, Morty.
RICK: Go to school, Summer. I’ll go in Morty’s memory and do a little Lambs to the cosmic slaughter!
MORTY: Well? You seem to be in charge of what I get to remember. Why?
RICK: Good question. Morty, I need darkness to prime these optical inductors. Hit the leftmost light switch by the door for me. The left. Okay, lights on. So, did I just hear three distinct light switch clicks?
MORTY: W-W-What do you mean?
RICK: I feel like the three sounds I heard could be explained by an initial erroneous flipping of a switch on the right followed by a hasty, corrective flipping of the requested switch. Then during the resultant darkness and silence, a third, shameful unflipping of the initially flipped switch. Is my assessment accurate?
MORTY: Yeah, that’s that’s basically how how it all shaked out. I’m sorry.
RICK: Ugh. All right, come on.
MORTY: What?!
RICK: Come on! Grab a shovel.
MORTY: W-What is
RICK: Grab a shovel! What was that? I can’t find a goddamn zip tie anywhere! All right, [BLEEP] it! Ahh, zip tie. Why are you making me do this for you again?
MORTY: Who doesn’t wish they could talk to animals, Rick?
RICK: Most humans! There, I’m done, just stay out of trouble!
SQUIRRELS: Gotta keep moving. Can’t stop. Up, down, down, up, up, up, down, up, stop, down. The queen needs food. The babies need food. The queen makes babies. The situation in Argentina has proven less convenient than predicted. We’ll have to re-destabilize their economy, refocus labor class outrage from upper to middle, foster a coup, and install a compliant regime. Same as Guatemala? Yes, but you can double time it. We need a quorum to pick a new pope, in case the Exxon/Monsanto thing falls through in Africa. Why not use chemtrails? Put a canopy on Uganda. They’re set to agitate any mo What? That kid is watching us. So, we’re squirrels, he’s a kid. He’s watching us like he hears what we’re saying. Hey, kid. Young man? Come here, little boy. Tell Daphne to run a 199 on a possible Dolittle. Little boy! We’ll give you wishes if you can hear us! We can make you fly and get candy.
MORTY: Oh, [BLEEP]! Oh, [BLEEP]! [Bleep] me! [Bleep] me! Rick!
RICK: Ah, [BLEEP], Morty, what did you do? All right, Morty, pack your shit! That’s only gonna keep ‘em down for a little bit, Morty! You [BLEEP] with squirrels, Morty! We got a good five minutes before they’re backing up on our ass, Morty! We have to pack up and move to a new reality, Morty! You know I said we could only do that a couple of times! We’re [BLEEP] over here because of these damn squirrels, Morty!
MORTY: I don’t know what my reaction is, but I think I’m mounting in suspicion of you.
RICK: - Well, what are you gonna do? -
MORTY: I’m gonna remember everything! Everything! Yeah! Ow! Ah! Ow!
RICK: Well, what’d you find out? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you gonna do, kill me?
MORTY: No, I’m not gonna kill you. I’m gonna kill myself! All those memories just erased! Sitting in this room collecting dust! W-What’s the point of going on if most of everything that happens just ends up sitting in here?
RICK: All right, kid. I don’t know much aside from the fact that "Men in Black 2" is a joyless cash grab, but I do know that whatever you have brewing around in your noggin really connected with you.I can’t deny that, and I can’t deny that I’m inspired by your passion. I want in Suicide pact! Yes, yeah, let’s do it! Together, you old son of a bitch! On three! One Two

TV: There’s a Craftsman nearby. I can smell it.
RICK: Whoa, what what
TV: Can I help you?
RICK: H-How did we fall asleep during interdimensional cable? -
MORTY: Yeah, what the hell, Summer? -
RICK: Summer, you dumb bitch! How long were we out, you dumb bitch! How much interdimensional cable did we miss, you stupid bitch! How many improv TV shows with commercials did we miss, Summer? Why did you let us fall asleep? You dumb bitch! You stupid bitch! All right, Morty, [BLEEP] this noise.Let’s get out of here and go on a classic Rick and Morty adventure.
MORTY: Yeah, right, Rick, I’m allin.

RICK: What?
SUMMER: Nothing.

JERRY: Rick? Hello? Just here for my putter. Jerry’s Mind Blowers?
HELICOPTER PASSENGER: Follow the boys! We’re charged and aimed at Alpha Centauri, ready for transport. They fell for it! Let’s send Gobo home! All right! -
SUMMER: Where’s dad? -
BETH: He should be here any second.
RICK: It’s funny, Jerry spent his life seeking attention, but in the end, humanity’s instinctive dismissal of him saved an alien’s life.
SUMMER: He knows where to go, right?
MORTY: Yep, any minute now.
JERRY: Did it work? Did you guys get Gobo home?
MORTY: You have Gobo! You were supposed to bring him to the hill!
JERRY: As if. He was in your basket.
MORTY: He was in your car! Oh! Oof! Dibs on his stuff. Did yoof that?
EPISODE
NEWS ANCHOR: In local news, child murderer Joseph Eli Lipnip is scheduled to die tomorrow by lethal injection, his execution already drawing dozens more spectators than the death of TV news. Carla?
CARLA JOHNSON: The man that once ate his own son
BETH: Wow. He’s really getting executed after all this time. You know the son that he ate was --
SUMMER: Your best friend -- Tommy. We know. Stop true-crime bragging.
BETH :I was traumatized, Summer. Okay, your generation wouldn’t get that.
SUMMER: Bitch, my generation gets traumatized for breakfast.
BETH: It took years of therapy to even process the reality. I mean, when I was a kid, I just told myself that Tommy had gotten lost in the magical realm of Froopyland.
SUMMER :"Froopyland?"
BETH: My make-believe world. I know the name’s stupid, but it was so real to me.
RICK: Aren’t you guys supposed to be at your father’s for custody weekend?
MORTY :We’re not in a hurry. Dad sleeps until sundown. Can we talk a little bit more about this Froopy--
[ ZAP, BLOOP ]
SUMMER :Not the bubble gun! There’s no air --
[ ZAP, BLOOP ]
BETH :I gotta say, I am warming up to the bubble gun.
RICK: You know, if you’re so great at naming things, why don’t you do it from now on?
BETH :-What?
RICK :-Froopyland. Was it my best work? I don’t know. Does it deserve to be shit on creatively? Yeah, that’s right. I agree with your look of horrified realization. You can be very inconsiderate sometimes.
(CUT TO GARAGE)
RICK :[ Rattling ] [ Grunting ] Here it is. You know, I collapsed a quantum tesseract to
BETH: -- Dad, I don’t care how you made it. I want to know if Tommy’s still in there!

BETH: Tommy! Tommy! This is a nightmare. I can’t believe you used to lock me up in this glorified chicken coop.
RICK: Chicken coop? Those are procedurally generated clouds, Beth. That river is a rainbow. Literally. Come on, I-I-I put real elbow grease into this place.
BETH: Well, you’re supposed to put elbow grease into your daughter!
RICK :Gross.
BETH: Do you think something ate him?
RICK: Nope. Froopyland creatures were designed to be harmless. He definitely just starved to death.
BETH: I could have been the one who starved to death in here. What if I’d gotten hurt?
RICK :God, you’re right. I’m a terrible dad. Well, nothing to live for. Goodbye, cruel world! (jumps off cliff)
BETH: Dad!
RICK :[ Thump ] Oh, how do you like that? What kind of merciless creator makes the ground bouncy? I’m gonna have to drown myself.
BETH: [Jumps, Thump ] Unh!
RICK :(sticks head in water) Oh, no. Oh, the water’s breathable? Who went and did that?
BETH :Oh, whatever.
RICK :Yeah, whatever. A dad makes a toilet look like R2-D2, and it breaks the front page of Reddit, but I’m Charles Manson because I gave you your own world instead of an iPad. I think the words you’re looking for are -- Aah! [Gets grabbed by a raptor. Screeches ] Holy [bleep] [Bleep] This thing has claws!
BETH :Yeah, I get it. It’s a childproof world.
RICK: No, no, seriously, this hurts really bad! This thing is sinking razor-sharp claws in -- Aah! [Bleep]
BETH: You’ve made your point, Dad. Dad?
(CUT TO SUMMER AND MORTY IN BUBBLE) [ POP, POP ]
MORTY :Ugh!
[ BOTH PANTING ]
SUMMER: Whose idea was this stupid custody weekend thing?
MORTY: I think it’s supposed to help prevent abandonment issues.
SUMMER: I want to be abandoned.
MORTY: Yeah, I’m talking about Dad.
JERRY: [ DOOR OPENS ] Bienvenue a la Chez Divorced Dad.
SUMMER: Wow, Dad. Your place looks way less like a crackhouse.
MORTY: It’s actually clean, like a cocaine house. Dad, what’s going on?
JERRY: I’m simply centered, activated -- [ GLASS CLINKS, WARBLE ]
MORTY :And telekinetic?
JERRY: Pretty cool, huh? Check it out. Who wants a smoothie? [ RATTLE, BLENDER WHIRRING ] Oh -- Oh, no. Uh, oh, God. Summer -- Summer, can you --
SUMMER :-Aah!
JERRY: -Sorry.
KIARA: [ WARBLE ] You have much to learn, my Uloo.
JERRY: Morty, Summer, this is Kiara. She’s a Krootabulan warrior priestess from Krootabulon.
MORTY: I-I know where Krootabulans are from, Dad. Uh, Chaimuntolo.
KIARA: Chaimuntolo, younglings.
SUMMER: Hymencholo.
KIARA: Your father’s mind holds love for you. I am humbled to meet in physicality.
SUMMER: Dad, are you
JERRY :-- In love with a badass, sexy alien lady? Ha, ha, I don’t know, Summer. You tell me.
SUMMER: I wasn’t going to ask if you were in love since you barely know her.
JERRY: Summer. Kiara and I met on that interstellar dating service Rick was always suggesting when your mom and I were together. And things just kind of clicked.
KIARA: We must move! Our reservation is at 7:00.
JERRY: [ WHOOSH ] I hate to see her leave, but I love to watch her phase shift away. I’m sure you noticed what she has three of, but guess what she has two of?
(FROOPYLAND)
RICK: [ SCREECHES ] Oof! All right, knock it off! Listen, I’ve been giving you a pass because I’m charmed that life finds a way, but -- Aah! All right, you know what? [ RAY GUN FIRES ] Ouch! Oh! Unh! Ouch! God! [ SIZZLING ] Aah! Agh! [ ARM CLICKS ]
BETH: Oh, yeah, this place is the safest. Best dad ever. Can’t you just say, "I admit it, I screwed up"?
RICK: Uh, what would be the point of that?
BETH: [ CHUCKLING ] You can’t do it, can you? You can’t just [bleep] apologize.
RICK: Okay, okay, Beth, I’m sorry you think you deserve an apology. [RAPTOR SCREECHES ] Hey, don’t look at me. You let your kid roll around on the floor of a target, it’s gonna get stepped on. [RAPTOR SCREECHES, WHIR, ZAP ] Huh. Well, here’s the problem right here. We’ve got a bunch of Froopyland procedural carbons all gummed up and mixed in with real human DNA.
BETH: Are you saying Tommy survived here by having sex with Froopy creatures, creating Froopy-human hybrid offspring, and then consuming their proteins, sustaining himself with an endless cycle of cannibalistic incest?
RICK: It’s just a working theory. Of course, if that’s the case, I expect he’d be worshiped as a kind of god by a medieval-level society of his least-delicious children.
(ENTER GROUP OF TOMMY'S OFFSPRING)
LEAD FROOPY CREATURE: Halt! You are now prisoners of our exalted ruler, giver and taker of life, helper and consumer of mortality, dispenser of life
RICK :-- Yeah, if I could interrupt? We’re way ahead of the reveal here.
BETH: Yeah, just take us to King Tommy.
(CUT TO RESTAURANT)
MORTY: I thought warrior priestesses could only leave Krootabulon on a hunt.
JERRY: Mmm. Thank you, sweetie.
MORTY: I hope it’s not human season.
KIARA: I’m on Earth hunting the Varrix. I would never hunt a human. Your father and I are soul-bonded.
MORTY: Soul-bonded?
SUMMER: Um, does your planet have shorter days, because you guys are moving kind of fast, no?
KIARA: Sniff [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS, WHOOSH, VARRIX ALIEN WAITER REVEAL]
JERRY: Go get him, honey! She’s always hunting. [ CHUCKLES ] She probably knew a Varrix worked here, and that’s why she said the Yelp reviews didn’t matter.
MORTY: Dad, do you understand how serious Krootabulon soul-bonding is?
JERRY: Uh, gee, Morty, I don’t know. It’s got such a casual name. If you want to lecture anyone about commitment, start with your mom.
SUMMER: Oh, my God. Dad, is that what this is about? Are you rushing into a new thing to get back at Mom?
JERRY: Every weekend, you two have told me to move on.
SUMMER: Move on, like, out of bed. Like, stop using paper towels for toilet paper, not move on into a sloppy rebound.
MORTY: Dad, you need to slow down, rethink this soul bond.
JERRY: Why don’t you just say what you really mean? You think it’s cool that having sex with her gives me telekinesis and you recognize she’s got a hot bod like Cheetara in "Thundercats," but you’re grossed out by her avocado-shaped head and blue skin, and you think I want to put a bag and a wig on her head. After all the time and energy I spent teaching you two about race [ VARRIX SCREAMS ] you ended up racist.
KIARA: [ WHOOSH ] Soon your world will be rid of Varrix. Tomorrow, we celebrate.
JERRY: We could take the kids to the water park.
KIARA: We celebrate with a hunt!
JERRY: Ooh. You kids want to hunt?
MORTY: -Yes.
SUMMER: -Yes.
(FROOPYLAND) [ TRUMPET FANFARE ]
OFFSPRING CREATURE: All kneel for King Tommy!
RICK: I’m not kneeling. Suck my [bleep]
TOMMY: Well, hello, all! I am the King of Froopyland, but I go by another name, too.
BETH: We know.
TOMMY: It’s Tommy!
BETH: -We know.
RICK: -We know.
TOMMY: I have lived here since I was a mere child.
BETH: -We know.
RICK: -Got it.
TOMMY: I suppose you’re wondering, how do I sustain myself?
RICK: -Oh, boy.
BETH: -No, we aren’t.
TOMMY: I always find the theater is the best way to clarify things.
BETH: -Ugh.
RICK: -Seriously?
BETH: Oh, my God.
TOMMY: Players, go!
(FROOPY CREATURES BEGIN DRAMA)
LITTLE TOMMY: I am little Tommy.
[ CROWD CHEERS ]
TINY BETH: I am tiny Beth.
[ CROWD BOOS ]
BETH: Oh, come on.
TINY BETH: Come with me to a magic land.
FROOPY VOICE :Don’t do it!
TINY BETH: This is my secret Froopyland where I have no rules!
LITTLE TOMMY: I am excited.
TINY BETH: I am jealous of Tommy’s friends and his Nintendo and his dad who likes him.
RICK: I take it Tommy wasn’t class playwright.
TINY BETH: You want to see the Honey Swamp?
LITTLE TOMMY: Yes! Let’s do it!
TINY BETH: Well, I want to see you dead.
LITTLE TOMMY: Ow, help! I’m stuck! I’m covered in honey.
RICK: Huh. Well, that’s interesting.
BETH: Fake news.
LITTLE TOMMY: Many nights have passed, trapped in this strange land. I am hungry, and all I can do to pass the time is hump. I will hump this rock. [ TAPPING ] I will hump this tree. [ TAPPING ] I will hump this beast of the land and put my seed in it.[ TAPPING ]
LITTLE OFFSPRING: I am the first of Tommy’s children. Eat of my flesh so you may survive.
LITTLE TOMMY: And so I did.
RICK: Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah. Certified fresh. Good -- Good job.
TOMMY: Perhaps a demonstration is in order.[ UNZIPS SHORTS ]
BETH: No, that is the last thing that is in order! Ugh. Oh, my God.
RICK: Poor Froopy character. Leave him alone.
TOMMY: [ SHORTS ZIP ] Ahh. Gather round, gang! [ MOOS ] Dinner time. [ SPLORCH ]
RICK: All right, that’s it. I’m outta here.
(DRAWS CIRCLE ON FLOOR AND LEAVES FROOPYLAND) (SMITH FAMILY LIVING ROOM)
BETH: What are you doing? We’re in the middle of an adventure.
RICK: Here’s some things an adventure needs, Beth. Conflict, stakes, a way for me to benefit, and, clearly, Morty.
BETH: But Tommy’s still in there, raping Muppets and eating babies.
RICK: Yep. Luckily, that’s not our problem. Time to pull the plug.
BETH: Pull the plug? We have to get Tommy out of there, okay? We -- We need to do the right thing. Do what you never did as a dad -- Put in a little effort.
RICK: All right, cut the high-road routine. We both saw Tommy’s shitty play. You pushed him in the Honey Swamp, Beth. His very happy life is in your hands. You go save him from it.
BETH: [ SCOFFS ] You’re gonna believe a play over your own daughter?
RICK: Yes, I am, Beth, because you’re not my own daughter.
BETH: Oh, God, yes. I’m one of infinite Beths with infinite fathers in infinite universes. It’s called a hug, Dad. It won’t kill you.
RICK: Yeah, don’t be so sure. You know why all Ricks made a Froopyland for all their little girls? Same reason I wasn’t surprised by Tommy’s overwritten, badly structured, cheaply produced flashback. You were a scary [bleep] kid, man.
BETH: [ SCOFFING ] Oh, my God.
RICK: I didn’t make Froopyland to get rid of you, Beth. I did it to protect the neighborhood. Not in a [burps] noble sense. It was just more practical to sequester you before I had to start, you know, cloning a replacement for every less-than-polite little boy or gullible animal that might cross your socio-path.
BETH: You would rather believe I’m evil than admit that you were a bad father?
RICK: Oh, dude, no. No, bad father all the way to the max over here. I’m a [bleep] nutcase. And the acorn plopped straight down, baby. Look at some of this shit you were asking me to make you as a kid. Ray guns. A whip that forces people to like you. Invisibility cuffs, a parent trap, a lightning gun, a teddy bear with anatomically correct innards, night-vision googly-eye glasses, sound-erasing sneakers, false fingerprints, fall-asleep darts, a lie-detecting doll, an indestructible baseball bat, a Taser shaped like a ladybug, a fake police badge, location-tracking stickers (time = 10:55 -5.243, 47.394, rainbow-colored duct tape, mind-control hair clips, poison gum, a pink, sentient switchblade.
PINK SENTIENT SWITCHBLADE: Hi, Beth, you’ve gotten taller. Shall we resume stabbing?
BETH: Has it occurred to you that I asked you to make those things because I wanted you to spend time with me? Has it occurred to you that if I did try killing Tommy, it might be because I was jealous of his family?
RICK: Wait, what? Why? Wasn’t his dad, like, some kind of cannibal? Seems like it must be hereditary.
BETH: Oh, my God. This is your fault. I am not a bad person. I’m gonna go back in there, I’m getting Tommy, and I’m fixing this!
(DRAWS DOOR ENTERS FROOPYLAND)
RICK: Whatever you say, Stone Cold Steve Austin. [ JINGLING ] I don’t know why I just said that. Doesn’t make a lot of sense, but gotta stand by it. Whatever you say, Stone Cold Steve Austin. I’m owning it.
(CUTS TO HUNT) [ AX SWINGS ]
MORTY :No, Dad! You’re not doing it right! [ AX SWINGS ]
JERRY: Cutting off their heads isn’t doing it right?
MORTY: They’re [grunts] clearly regenerative! I-I think you have to stab them through the heart or something.
SUMMER: You think or you know? I thought you were the alien expert, Isaac Asi-hole.
MORTY: Don’t snap at me! I’m tired!
SUMMER: -Me, too!
JERRY: -We’re all tired! [ AX SWINGS, WHOOSH, GRUNTS ]
KIARA: That’s the last of them. Tonight, we celebrate.
JERRY: With a hunt?
KIARA: Yes, for tomorrow, we hunt.
(JERRY BRINGS KIDS BACK TO SMITH HOUSE)
JERRY: [ RAIN TRICKLING, CLEARS THROAT ] I, uh, really have to get out of this soul bond.
SUMMER: -What the [bleep] Dad?
MORTY: -Oh, my God! Duh!
SUMMER: -Obviously!
MORTY: -Yeah, no kidding!
JERRY: Can you guys help me?
MORTY: What? How?
JERRY: Can I just, uh, tell her it’s because of my kids? You know, like, you don’t like the shape of her head, or
SUMMER: -- That’s you, Dad! That’s you! You’re a baby and an idiot!
JERRY: I think that’s been established, Summer. Now help me!
SUMMER: First, I want you to admit that you’re a closet racist, a beta-male sexist, and you dragged everyone into a horrible situation by only thinking of yourself.
JERRY: Okay.
SUMMER: I want to hear you say it.
JERRY: [ SIGHS DEEPLY ] Look, I’m a closeted racist, and I’m sexist and selfish, and I dragged us all into my sexist, racist bad things because I’m stupid.
SUMMER: Thank you.
JERRY: Now you’re gonna help me, right?
MORTY: She just did.
SUMMER: Yeah, clean up your own mess.
JERRY: Wait, wait, what? Oh, man.
(FROOPYLAND) [ TRUMPET FANFARE ]
TOMMY :All right, everybody. Next item on the docket -- I would like to have sex with some of you, and then eat the babies. [ FROOPYS MURMURING ] I thought you’d like that. I do keep rolling out the hits, don’t I? [ BANG BETH SLAMS DOOR OPEN ] Oh! It’s the Magic Crayon Lady! Are you hungry? I was just about to make dinner. And by "make dinner," I mean
BETH: -- Tommy, I’m going to take you to the real world.
TOMMY: Well, this is the real world.
BETH: No, you don’t understand! Your dad -- Uh, people think your dad ate you!
TOMMY: So? You doy-oy! People should eat people. Just leave me alone!
BETH: Tommy, you don’t understand. I have to make this right because it’s my fault that you’re in here. I’m Beth.
[ ALL GASP ]
TOMMY: -Beth? -The destroyer!
BETH: Oh, suck it up, Princess Incest. You fell into some honey.
TOMMY: Well, it tends to happen when one is pushed into honey.
BETH: I respect your right to believe I pushed you.
TOMMY: Oh, do I get to have that? Is my reality like a little side of fries -- a little Kwanzaa you’re willing to slide my way?
BETH: Yes, because I’m focused on saving your father’s life because I’m not a petty piece of [bleep]
TOMMY: So, then, it should be pretty easy to say, "Sorry I pushed you."
BETH: Real easy and not necessary, since you coming home will save your dad’s life whereas nothing is changed by anyone stroking your batshit-crazy ego.
TOMMY: Sorry, forgive me. Uh, I’ve been in Froopyland for quite a while. Have apologies changed?
BETH: Tommy, I’m sorry you think you deserve an apology. Oh, my God. I’m my father.
TOMMY: Uh, will someone just kill this B-word?
[ FROOPYS MUTTERING THREATENINGLY ]
BETH: [ Grunts ] Hi-ya! Oh, my God. I’m my father! Ya! Ooh!
[FROOPY SCREAMS ]
PINK SENTIENT SWITCHBLADE :It’s stab time!
FROOPIES: Ooh!
[CUT TO SCHOOL, SCHOOL BELL RINGS ]
MATH TEACHER: And that’s why one pussy plus two pussies makes a bunch of pussies. Come on, y’all, I’m trying to make this appealing to your sex-addicted lifestyles.
JERRY: Hi, I need to pull Morty out of school. Come on, Morty.
BULLY: Ha! You heard your daddy, Morty. you have to leave school. Wait, what are my values?
SUMMER: Dad, what’s going on?
JERRY: We’re going to Alaska.
MORTY: What? Why?
JERRY: It’s nice there. Also, I broke up with Kiara, and she didn’t take it well, and she wants to murder you two.
MORTY: What? Th-Then why are we walking?
JERRY :I’m walking because I’m tired. You guys should definitely run.
[ENTER KIARA WHOOSH ]
KIARA: [ SCREAMS, THUD ] Excuse me, I just -- You know what? I’m -- I’m just gonna go left. No, okay, your left, that’s fine. Do you know what left is, ‘cause -- Ugh!
MORTY: What does your breakup have to do with us? [ ENGINE STARTS ]
SUMMER: Yeah, we chose Mom hands down. I thought we made that clear at the lawyer’s office and in the comments under your weird rant on Facebook.
JERRY: [ CRASH, TIRES SQUEAL ] She kind of blames you guys for the breakup.
SUMMER: -Why?
MORTY :-Why?
JERRY: Because I told her it was your fault.
SUMMER: -What?!
MORTY :-What?!
JERRY: Look, I’m not an evil person. I’m just not very imaginative! [ WARBLING, GRUNTS, METAL TWISTING ] Oh! [ ALL SCREAM ]
RICK :Doo-doo butt Doo-doo-doo -- doo-doo butt No. [ JINGLING ] Doo-doo butt, doo-doo butt
BETH: Hey.
RICK: Hey.
BETH: Um, hmm, so just, like, out of curiosity, if you were gonna make a clone of Tommy, what would you need to get started?
RICK: I don’t kn-- Tommy’s DNA?
BETH: Okay, ‘cause he, um Yeah, he didn’t want to come back, so, um, he gave me this.
RICK: He gave you his finger?
BETH: Uh, well, what happened is
RICK: -- It’s okay. It doesn’t matter.
BETH: Okay.
RICK: This’ll take about three hours.
BETH: Okay.
RICK: Hey. You want to help?
BETH: Okay.
(MUSIC WHILE BETH AND RICK MAKE CLONE OF TOMMY{ DOO I GOT A DOO-DOO IN MY BUTT DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO AND I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE DOO-DOO IN MY BUTT BUT I KNOW THAT A FATHER SHOULD SAY TO YOU THAT HE’S PROUD OF YOU DOO EVERY DAUGHTER IS A DOO-DOO FROM A FATHER’S BUTT BIOLOGICALLY SPEAKING, THE BUTT IS A NUT AND EVERY FATHER FATHERS WRONG OOH AND THERE ISN’T A SONG THAT CAN CHANGE THAT })
BETH: I am wiped out. I guess I’ll turn in.
RICK: Cool.
BETH: Dad? I feel like I’ve spent my life pretending you’re a great guy and trying to be like you. And the ugly truth has always been
RICK: -- That I’m not that great a guy and you’re exactly like me.
BETH: Am I evil?
RICK: Worse. You’re smart. When you know nothing matters, the universe is yours. And I’ve never met a universe that was into it. The universe is basically an animal. It grazes on the ordinary. It creates infinite idiots just to eat them, not unlike your friend Timmy.
BETH: Tommy.
RICK: Yeah, it hardly matters now, sweetie. You know, smart people get a chance to climb on top, take reality for a ride, but it’ll never stop trying to throw you. And, eventually, it will. There’s no other way off.
BETH: Dad, I’m out of excuses to not be who I am. So who am I? What do I do?
RICK: My advice -- Take off. Put a saddle on your universe. Let it kick itself out.
BETH: I can’t do that. The kids, Jerry, my job, and, as much as I hate to admit it, ABC’s "The Bachelor."
RICK: I can make a clone of you, a perfect instance of you, with all your memories. An exact copy in every way. It’ll love and provide for the kids, do your job, and consume broadcast-network reality TV on the same allegedly ironic level as you. You could be gone a day, a week, or the rest of your life with zero consequences. The moment you decide to come back, I flip a switch, and the clone’s job is done. It feels no pain, it regrets nothing, and has zero chance of going "Blade Runner."
BETH: If nothing matters, why would you do that for me?
RICK: I don’t know, maybe you matter so little that I like you. Or maybe it makes you matter. Maybe I love you. Maybe something about your mother. Don’t jump a gift shark in the mouth.
BETH: I don’t know if I can do it.
RICK: Then stay, and luxuriate in a life you can finally know you’ve chosen. My secret bonus is that no matter what you choose, you’re finally gonna chill the [bleep] out.
BETH: Okay. I know what I want to do.
(CUT TO CAVE)
KIARA: [ WHOOSH ] Aah! [ THUD ] Ow! You can’t run forever!
SUMMER: She’s really pissed off.
JERRY: I know. It’s kinda hot.
SUMMER: Shut up!
VARRIX: The hunters! They’re back! Run!
MORTY: -We’re not hunters.
SUMMER: -We want to hide with you.
VARRIX: We’re not hiding. We’re nesting.
MORTY: Ooh la la.
KIARA: [ ALL SCREAM ] The children must be destroyed so that we can be together.
SUMMER: You need to break up with her, Dad -- properly! [ WHOOSH ] God damn it, Dad! [ GRUNTS ] Dump her!
JERRY: Okay, okay. Kiara, let’s just run away.
SUMMER: -Dad!
MORTY :-Come on!
SUMMER: Just rip the Band-Aid off!
JERRY: Okay! Kiara, when I told you my kids were bigoted racists who were demanding I break up with you, I lied. If anybody deserves to be telekinetically strangled, it’s me. I’m the one who wants to break up. I -- I’m not an evil person. I’m lazy, I’m cowardly, and -- and I do not know what I’m doing. Look, I got someone pregnant at 17. We’re getting a divorce. None of this is on purpose. I was excited to date someone cool because it would make my ex notice me.
KIARA: I would expect nothing less from humanity -- a selfish, manipulative, dishonest species that
TRANDOR :-- -Kiara?
KIARA: -Trandor!
TRANDOR: What are you doing here?
KIARA: Just hunting.
TRANDOR: Do you really expect me to believe it has nothing to do with us? You knew Earth was my domain.
KIARA: I don’t like what you’re insinuating.
SUMMER: Dad, can we go now?
JERRY: Hold on a second. I’m starting to get the feeling that I was the rebound.
MORTY: Dad, you just got handed an Ex Machina. You’re taking it.
TRANDOR: Varrix nests spread across 300 galaxies, and you just happened to pick this planet to hunt? That’s Gorgon shit -- total Gorgon shit!
(SMITH HOUSE) [ BIRDS CHIRPING ]
SUMMER: We’re home!
BETH: Hey, guys!
SUMMER: What’s for dinner?
BETH: How was Jerry’s?
SUMMER: The usual. Can we have pizza?
BETH: Pizza sounds great.
MORTY: Hey, Rick, did you know my dad was dating an alien? No.
RICK: Gross.: For the alien.
BETH: Aw, crap, I think Arnaldo’s is closed. Are you guys sure you want pizza?
RICK: [ WHOOSH ] Arnaldo’s isn’t closed in the dimension where they didn’t invent Daylight Savings!
BETH: What would we do without you? I love you, Dad.
RICK: Love you, too, sweetie. By the way, that wasn’t time travel. There were just a couple pizzas on the counter. I grabbed them.
